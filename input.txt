Cannabis is a true miracle 'drug' with very few negative side effects for the overwhelming majority of the population. It's a shame the drug czars have so recklessly demonized it the last hundred years, but what else would you expect from 'conservatism' and the puritanical Know Nothings ? A sizable portion of the population has performed scientific testing on cannabis for decades and the results are in: Cannabis is very good affordable antidote for a rainbow of physical ailments and illnesses and has limited adverse effects when used judiciously....and the pharmaceutical companies and 'conservatives' are devastated at this good news for society. Enjoy your edibles, gummies other cannabis infused delights.
