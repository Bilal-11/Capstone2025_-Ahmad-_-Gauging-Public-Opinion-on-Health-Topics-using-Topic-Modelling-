        "I've been through all of this several times and finally after more than twenty years came out clean, but the odds were absolutely stacked against me and it took several tries in 4 different states to get where I am now. \nOne HUGE problem is the overwhelming majority of clinics are for profit, just like the very same people who sell illicit drugs on the street, for profit. WAY too much profit motive in it..And it's a hefty profit at that and they all keep less than bankers hours.  Methadone by itself costs clinics literally pennies on the dollar and they almost always jack the prices up till patients are often left to choose between a hot meal or the utter misery of withdrawal. There's typically a very small window of the day when patients can even access clinics often with overburdensome rules and staff seemingly hell bent on turning patients away for even the slightest infraction of the rules.\nClinics are typically, although not always located far away from residential areas where actual addicts live in industrial areas, off freeways usually not on bus lines or bus lines a mile or more away. Nobody wants a clinic in their neighborhood even IF the neighborhood is full of addicts stealing everything not nailed down and even if a local clinic far outweighs the risk of having a clinic close by..\nThen there's clinic staff.

I think it's silly, stupid, and dishonest to speak of drugs being the problem or to focus on curing addiction or to speak of people as morally weak. \n\nCountless Americans work literally back breaking jobs, try pushing even something as simple as a dust mop for hours at a time to see what I mean, and are in constant physical pain. Try asking someone who pushes a dust mop if they physically exercise on their time off and they might say why would they do that when they are literally forced into exercise at their job to point of getting muscle or other injuries which never get time to heal because you have to be at the job again the next day. \n\nAnd you can tell a lot about a person's life by their choice or choices of drugs: Alcohol, opiates to dull actual pain, amphetamines to speed up thought and body so maybe you can just think your way out of things or move ahead of things more rapidly, psychedelics so maybe you can just \"break on through to the other side\" in the immortal words of the Doors, marijuana because you just plain want to move at a more relaxed and joyful pace in an environment which permits no such thing.\n\nNo, I don't look down on drug addicts, the world we live in is a heartbreaker, it takes superhuman effort to change things for the better, and if drugs make us feel super so be it.",

The \"moral\" case ironically seems to be to casting current systems, processes, methods and practitioners as uncaring and inneffective at treating the addicted - in essence, framing the existing treatment framework as immoral, judgemental and purposefully designed to fail people who are simply ill (through no fault of their own, just like diabetes and cancer patients.) The \"moral\" aspects of personal responsibility are avoided. As for the \"practical\" case, it speaks of the costs of \"lost productivity\", which assumes some level of productivity across the board prior to addiction which may not necessarily have existed. It also speaks to other measureable costs without regard to the costs of the article's featured treatment options. (Having a \"support team\" of professionals available for periods of years is unlikely to yield any \"practical\" savings over  current systems and methods. Ditto for \"making treatment drugs much cheaper or free.\") The article stands the concept of \"morality\" on its head and fails to make the case for \"practicality\" - both in terms of overall cost and organizational reality - substituting smoke and mirrors rationalization for real practical analysis.

        "When it comes to medical intervention to addictions, which is largely physical, the medical industry and doctors suddenly shut up and go quiet. Instead of the usual suggestion of using the medication against alcohol abuse and heroine/opioid abuse, they go silent. They leave treatment up to the patient, who sits around in a circle confessing their addiction \u201csins\u201d to others in the group meeting in the basement of a church or a community center, hoping blindly that this patient will heal themselves by listening to their own confessions to find root cause, which is emotional, and not chemical and scientific. The whole industry of AA is a shame, ginned up by a religious person with no medical intervention to date. To think addiction specialists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and doctors trained in this won\u2019t speak out about it is absurd. Insurance won\u2019t cover it as a physical addiction.\n\nThey thus make it hard to use clearly known medicines that work. The silence is unethical and reflects what appears to be tacit support of the alcohol industry, making it seem like a \u201cdependency\u201d without physical \u201chooks.\u201d In short, their silence is unethical.",

Something is wrong with our society when so many people in one of the richest countries in the world cannot cope with life and need to turn to various addictive substances. I'd like to see the addiction rates across the world and compare that to various other data points. Is it the way we have set up society - winner takes all -that drives people to harm themselves? Is it the cultural acceptance of alcohol and it being cool to be high? Is it the lack of good medical care and very little attention paid to prevention because we have a model that thrives when you're sick rather than when you're healthy? Is it because to make ends meet parents have so little time to be with their children? Is it because we have a terrible food system with no nutrition? Is it the loss of community?

Unfortunately, it is substantially wrong in many ways.\nI have unique experience + expertise in these matters, different and perhaps superior to most other people. \nDuring the late 1970s, the National Institute on Drug Abuse supported a data system named CODAP. I was in charge. I had written authorization from the people in charge of drug abuse to have the supreme authority to manage CODAP. It was done because otherwise the system was not manageable.\n\n We collected data from about 100K people in treatment in over 1,000 federally funded clinics (practically most clinics in the US). We had data on most people treated for drug abuse in the US. I designed, implemented, supervised the system.\n\nI prepared responses to members of Congress, The White House, news media, government agencies. We trained the states on the system. I communicated with the heads of state government agencies. I wrote reports. I visited many clinics, spoke to managers, psychiatrists, counselor across the US. Any data analysis required my review and approval. I had unique access about the effectiveness of treatment.\n\nBefore I took over, it took years to get a table of data. Costs projected to exceed by far the agency budget. After I redesigned the system, we got tables within 2 hours. I received several of the highest PHS awards. My main finding: current methods fail. The US needs very different approach. Cannot explain in 1500 characters.",

        "After 13 years of addiction, my son recently passed away. He went to rehabs and detox places numerous times, and was sometimes kicked out for a single relapse. These places should always offer second chances. He was also on and off buprenorphine for years. The treatments and the \u201caddiction specialists\u201d were overwhelmingly ineffective and indifferent. Some places tolerated violence and drug-dealing. Precious few treated him humanely. After his final OD, after he was found  in a housing project stairwell with drug paraphernalia next to him, the hospital said they found no drugs in his system. The reason, I found out, was because it, like many hospitals in NYC, don't test for fentanyl. OD deaths are under-counted in New York. Contrary to current wisdom, there\u2019s no magic bullet, including buprenorphine. After many years of living with and losing a person I dearly loved, I think I\u2019m qualified to give some suggestions: Methadone clinics should be open seven days per week. Currently, in NYC, they\u2019re open only six days. All addiction-licensed doctors should be required to accept Medicaid in order to prescribe buprenorphine and similar meds. Likewise, addiction clinics such as the good one at Bellevue should be open all the time. Bellevue\u2019s clinic is open only two mornings per week. \nGood heroin should be available to licensed addicts so that they don\u2019t die from the poison that killed my son. \nFinally, more border control. 95% of all fentanyl comes from Mexico.",

Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9, the leading expert on the condition, learned that pain, whether physical or psychic, is a precursor to addiction.  Let's take a look at the big picture:\n\n--Population and birthrates are falling rapidly.  Young people, knowing what they know from the internet, no longer wish to have children.  The Republicans' solution is to increase the punishment for getting pregnant and leaving women with no choice if they don't want an unwanted child that they cannot care for.\n\n--The homeless population represents unwanted people.  Because of work requirements and the cost of living, neither parent, if they are still together, have time or energy to raise a child properly.  Some parents are even blaming their own children for being born.\n\n--All of our institutions have failed.  Churches are built on a lie and are repelling anyone but reich-wingers from joining.  Colleges are absurdly expensive and increasingly irrelevant.  A large percentage of Americans despise their government, even though it is the most reliable, honest and supportive institution in their lives.  The Republican Party is a corrupt and despicable arm of the Russian Federation.\n\n--People have generally lost hope.  Thus, more deaths of despair and more people who don't care.

It works exactly like any habit people develop, and habits are very strong behaviors. Habits do not seem powerful until one resists them. Then one becomes familiar with how hard it is to change or eliminate them. The description of addiction as a disease is a poor analogy. Diseases are external agents affecting an organism which seeks to fight them off. Addictions originate in the normal behavior of humans' reliance upon habitual behaviors to regulate themselves. and that is where it must be treated. There are powerful cravings that must be addressed to overcome and to revise the habitual behaviors, but they are conditioned reactions associated with some unfulfilled needs that are unsatisfied.",

        "I struggle between feeling deep sympathy towards individuals afflicted with addictions and having to survive on the street and feeling fear and annoyance when their messy lives spill into ours.  3 years ago, an elderly neighbor in his 80s died after an addicted homeless man took a swipe at his dog and caused my neighbor to fall and hit his head.  My neighbor survived WWII and was a refugee after the war but his life ended this way.   The homeless addict was released after being in jail for a year and is still using and is back on his usual street corner.  Two years ago, my dog ate trash left in front of my house by a homeless drug user and was hospitalized for 2 days for meth ingestion.  Last year my young daughter walked out of our house to find a man shaving using our car side mirror and wearing only underwear.  He made lewd comments to her and refused to move then proceeded to inject drugs between his toes before the police came.  \n\nWe live here too and many of us in San Francisco have compassion fatigue.  Given the always limited resources, I feel like putting effort into children now, the next generation, to prevent them becoming addicted adults is a better choice and will help more people overall than the tremendous resources needed to get adults often addicted and homeless for years, maybe in the grips of mental illness as well, off the street.  \n\nI am not sure if everyone wants to or can be helped.

        "Better treatment is needed but what it seems like everyone is failing to miss is the root issue of why so many of our friends and neighbors ended up here in the first place. Outside of a medical issue where opioids were prescribed, I would venture to guess most people are turning to drugs as an escape. If we also made a real effort as a country to improve the education system, to focus on opportunities for meaningful work and living wages with a path to success (owning a home, buying a car) and respect for all types of work, then perhaps people would want to be a part of society, rather than wanting to escape it. Our education system is failing, job opportunities are outsourced and small town life is dying and replaced by big box stores. It's no wonder people feel hopeless and want an escape. I commend these efforts and agree the stigma and treatment around substance abuse disorder needs to change to help encourage people to get the treatment they need, but as a country we need to ensure we are providing viable pathways and opportunities that are more compelling options than drug use.",

        "Let's face it, as much as a substance abuser might want to get clean - they like getting high - it makes them feel good even though it is having negative effects on their health and their lives. I speak from experience - my own and that of family and friends. This, in addition to the physical side effects of getting clean, makes it incredibly difficult to get and stay clean.  Good treatment programs are so very very important - AND the person has to be ready to face life without the drug or drugs they have become dependent on.  \n\nThat being said, I would love to see more resources put toward prevention.  I don't have the answer, but am asking the question - primarily of the people who have had to deal with substance abuse disorders, before you got started, or early on in your experimentation, what - if anything - could have gotten you on a better path?  addressing this question and targeting at risk youth and young adults with prevention strategies will diminish the need for rehabs and improve our society.",

        "I believe aspirin is no longer a recommended profilactic for heart attacks.\nI think if addiction existed solely as a standalone problem we'd see many more people being treated effectively.  But addiction is tied up with crime and homelessness making it hard for the public to sympathize with addicts.  Here the overwhelming public sympathy for getting addicts into treatment led the adoption of a law decriminalizing small amounts of hard drugs for personal use.  This has further degraded public life as addicts now openly buy and use hard drugs on our streets.  Combined with a shortage of treatment options, counseling, and mental health facilities the situation is a complete mess.  We can't fix all these interconnected problems at once, but we can't seem to decide which ones we can tackle and which ones we are therefore willing to pay for.

This worked to my advantage.) She'd come over to bring food and companionship, but otherwise I wasn't letting myself out until the withdrawal had passed and I was truly ready to get clean. My mom was paying my rent at that point in my life (long story for another day\u2014I was 19), but I attribute a lot of the success I had getting clean (and to this day staying clean) to completely rejecting \"help\" from social workers or rehab. A lot of people never even knew I was on drugs.\n\nLater, in 2013, after a long strange year between graduating from college and my life turning around, I ended up homeless on the streets of Seattle. I quickly figured out that trying to get housing through any social service agency was a recipe for becoming as dependent on social workers as I'd been on amphetamines 20 years earlier.\n\nInstead, I took advantage of the minimum required needs offered (I am eternally grateful to Compass Housing Alliance's public hygiene center) but otherwise got myself a job and saved up until I could pay market rent on an apartment.

There is no mental or physical disease that demonizes and criminalizes its sufferers like the disease of addiction.  You have uncovered a world of which so very many people are completely unaware. Those of us who are in recovery have had to work extremely hard and know that relapse is right around the block, one minute away.  Your description of what it is like trying to find badly needed continuing health care after getting out of rehab and/or prison is spot on.

        "This is such a sympathetic, thorough and thoughtful article. Thanks and well done.\n\nAnyone who has struggled with addiction, been through treatment or has loved ones struggling with addiction knows that the situation is often intractable. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with 12-step programs, know that they are firmly rooted in Christian orthodoxy. For many this is great and for others it is not, especially when there is righteous groupthink and/or judgement toward an individual. Alternatively, there are atheist and agnostic 12-step meetings that are more fluid and forgiving. There are also programs based on traditional 12-step programs which have no religious affiliation and are rooted in science and medicine more than faith.\n\nThat said, oftentimes those who are best suited to help addicts are people in recovery themselves. In fact, a crucial part of 12-step programs is bringing the message of recovery to those in need. It is circular: helping others IS part of the recovery process.\n\nCoordination between addicts in recovery and medical professionals is necessary to treat addiction. Hospital ERs have social workers on-site, many of whom are in recovery themselves. More of this is coordination needed.\n\nFinally, those who profit from addiction should pay. Drug companies and alcohol producers should be held liable. Simply saying, \u201cDrink responsibly\u201d isn\u2019t enough. \n\n\u201cFewer than 1 percent of those addicted to alcohol are being treated with medication.\u201d This is a national health emergency.",

        "A lot of persons in these comments talking about how the person has to want to get sober, which is true BUT which . exactly ignores the point of this article which is that a lot of them DO want to and  are routinely kicked out of recovery or treatment due to byzantine systems and old schools practices not supported by evidence as well as lack of insurance coverage, transportation and more. Addiction a is biopsychosocial disease meaning genetics, mental health and psychology and living situation/community all play a role in the addiction and perpetuation of addiction. There will always be that guy who hit 'rock bottom' drinking under a bridge who bounced back with 12-stpe alone. Great for him. But that guy is not everyone. In fact the evidence very plainly shows he is the EXTREME exception, not the rule. Maybe someone else's genetics are different. Or mental health is different. Or their childhood and childhood adverse experiences are different. Or the neighborhood/family/state they live in is different. Maybe it is ALL different. All people need to be able to access all of the effective treatment options. And right now it is near impossible. The system is fragmented, underfunded, and the health system as a whole undereducated on this particular topic. Vast sums are being spent but not in the right places- in part because people the public and legislatures refuse to 100% let go of the old blame and shame game and truly invest in the infrastructure needed.",

Then the question becomes: How many resources should society devote to such hit-or-miss outcomes?  (I don't pretend to have a good answer to this question.)\n\nSecond point:  In their relations with family, friends, acquaintances, and society at large, addicts can often be manipulative, dishonest, and infuriating, and they often steal, injure, and damage others both physically and psychologically.

        "Dismissal of 12-step programs as ineffective is very common. One statement here is especially egregious in this regard: \u201cthey [Alcoholics Anonymous] have also been known to actively discourage the use of lifesaving anti-addiction medications.\u201d Really? Known by whom, exactly? And to what are \u201cthey\u201d pointing as evidence to support this claim? Nowhere in AA\u2019s literature is there anything remotely close to saying this. Indeed, here is actual evidence of what AA has to say about medical treatment for alcoholism: \u201cthis world,\u201d according to the foundational book, _Alcoholics Anonymous_, published in 1939, is \u201csupplied \u2026 with fine doctors, psychologists, and practitioners of various kinds. Do not hesitate to take your health problems to such persons. Most of them give freely of themselves, that their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies.\u201d And \u201cwe should never belittle a good doctor or psychiatrist. Their services are often indispensable in treating a newcomer [to sobriety] and in following his case afterward\u201d (p. 133). See too the forward to the second edition (1955): \u201cIn all probability, we shall never be able to touch more than a fair fraction of the alcohol problem in all its ramifications. Upon therapy for the alcoholic himself, we surely have no monopoly\u201d (p. xxi). An appendix to that same edition cites a then-famous scientist as warning against \u201ccontempt prior to investigation\u201d (p. 568). Evidence-based indeed.",

And once you make this choice to poison yourself, why should I have any empathy for you? Addicts are a danger to others.

Talk to the women harassed and assaulted on the streets. Ask a child what the life with an addicted parent is like.

All the therapy staff were required to be licensed to work at the facility which was located in a hospital, which was handy given the access to specialized care needed for the patients, and provided experts in Addiction Medicine for the rest of the hospital, including the Emergency Department where many persons suffering from addictions would end up.  \n\nThe therapy was top notch It was trauma informed care, included the familles, and worked closely with aftercare providers in the community that were part of the same hospital system, so continuing care was seamless.

But opioid addition arises from decisions by its victims to use opioids to the point of dependency. These drugs are addictive to be sure, so there is an involuntary component. But addiction is also the result of very bad personal choices. People must take ownership and responsibility for their own behavior.\n\nThe Times has printed many articles on the social needs America should address, most at great expense.  These include domestic issues such as elder care, special needs children, illegal immigration for those from broken countries, those without medical insurance, unaffordable medications, the need for lifelong custodial care for severe mental illness, and many others.  There are also the wars in Ukraine and the middle east. There is much society needs to do, but only so much we can afford. The unavoidable reality is that we need to set priorities.\n\nI believe we should make appropriate, publicly funded, care available to treat addiction.  But only up to a point. Those who repeatedly relapse need to take personal responsibility; they are committing a serious crime. At some point treating addiction as a crime is appropriate.",

Methadone is costly for many, around 100/week on average, but that is peanuts compared to the cost of street drugs. \nThere are a lot of restrictions on prescribing, because like any drug, it has a high potential for abuse. The recovering addict must be highly motivated to stay sober, and support groups are fundamental to success. I think we need to be wary about loosening restrictions. It is mainly the secondary support, things like transportation, clinic access that would make the most difference.\nMy friend picks up a month's supply of doses, but she had to work her way up to that over a period of years. In the beginning, the recovering addict is not able to regulate their use, so they go to the clinic daily. The good thing is, you can't get kicked out for messing up, they just drop you back to daily dosing until you can prove yourself.\nYes, there is a lot of voodoo among addicts about Methadone Maintenance Therapy.

        "I recovered from drug addiction after two stints in treatment centers. The damage to me was the result of a homophobic society and narcissistic dysfunctional family. I was told as someone born gay that who I was is not who I am allowed to be. This came from religious people and accepted by society as a whole. The second part was a family with a narcissistic mother who berated and hamulated me and my twin. I was abused physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually by my family. I recovered because the drug use took me to a bottom where I became willing to change. This change was joining AA and adopting a black German shepherd puppy. The date February 18th  2005. I learned from the program AA that I needed to change for others to change around me. It was apparent I was not equipped  to handle life on life's term, the 12 step program gave me the road map, but it was the unconditional love from my dog that gave me the courage to change. It was the first time in my life that I had experience  this type of love. When the dog passed in 2016 I felt true  grief for the first time as well. By this time I was a different person, life had gotten better. I remember understanding the gift the puppy had given me and decided to keep on the path to honor his memory. The point is life had set me up to fail and the drug abuse almost killed me. I am one of the lucky ones but had I experience acceptance and love at an earlier age my life would have been much different.",

        "Thanks  Jeneen Interlandi for an article that actually has knowledge of the subject.  The humanistic approaches of harm reduction and using bupenrenine and methadone are right on.  As is the point that people need jobs, something to keep busy and give meaning and most importantly change scenery.  I would like to see the Biden admin do a National Anti Climate change workforce.  People digging berms in the desert, building earthships, culling overgrown forests, installing reflective surfaces, building solar panels.\n\nMy one big concern with the author's approach is that with fentanyl (as she notes) things have changed and so must prevention. I'm in general against war on drugs, but with exceptions for meth tranq and fentanyl.  I would like to see very strong penalties against importers and dealers, along with sanction vs. the manufacturers.  I'm not a big fan of meth users as I live near some, it not a good thing to have that destructive energy near. I truly wonder if their brains are permanently rotted. Maybe try to do immense fines vs. meth sellers and mfrs. If the sellers are not here legally, send them out of country one way trip.",

I am both heartened to see this article, yet saddened because I have seen no many like it, and change comes so slowly. Substance use disorders are the only DSM 5 disorder in which treatment is entrusted to those whose only qualification is involvement in a 12 step program. The problem is that these people are likely to reject evidence based practices. People on suboxone are encouraged to get off it, and are congratulated when they do, even against a doctor's recommendation. Methadone is seen as something concocted by Satan himself. Many consider trauma to be an excuse and I have seen people with PTSD symptoms being told to \"Make a gratitude list and talk to your sponsor.\" Most people who work in the field are fine, well meaning individuals, however the \"siloing\" that the author describes is inexcusable, especially when government funds are used to pay for it.",

I see worse problems today with opioids that are overkill for most pain treatment handed out like candy by dentists, doctors and hospitals.  Much of this stems from  companies like Purdue pushing \u201cpain level\u201d as the 5th vital sign, though it is a self-diagnosis unlike the other vitals, and hospitals being rated on pain management as if we can make you feel healthy and normal after your have sustained an injury or contracted a painful illness.   And those teams of pain management specialists have had zero time in detox and recovery rotations - they have no idea about the devastation they create when people leave the hospital creating new addicts or sending existing ones into a tailspin.  This is a complex problem with no simple answer, and one that devastates our society.  I think the numbers of sufferers given here is highly under-estimated.  \n\nWe need a lot more research and treatment plans.  And a lot more compassion.

        "I find myself astonished by an apparent lack of interest by NYT readers in this article. Nearly every issue that this very excellent piece by Ms. Interlandi discusses has affected me and my family. Both my children are heroin & meth addicts & have been for 12 years. \nThey came to these drugs for different reasons. My oldest suffers from treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Over the past 15 years, therapy & every psychotropic medication has failed to help her. It is a struggle for her EVERY DAY not to commit suicide to end her suffering. She says heroin is the only thing that has ever given her a moment of mental and emotional peace, but at great cost to her and me. She contracted a MRSA infection that permanently damaged her heart & very nearly killed her at age 32. After 6 weeks in hospital, 5 days on ventilator, months at home on IV antibiotic therapy that I administered, tied to a catheter with loss of bowel control, & months of physical therapy (mostly out-of-pocket @ $100/day) to get her to even be able to walk again, she went back to using. That is the depth of her despair. Shame & stigma are real for both addicts & families. I have such horrifying tales to tell. \nMy younger daughter is a different story with different tragic circumstances. Prison without ordered treatment, beaten by inmates & untreated concussion, using drugs in prison, released addicted. My two bright, compassionate girls, & me, reduced to nearly death. In 2023, there must be a better path.",

Perhaps if one includes alcohol, smoking and cell phone use in the penumbra of substances that are abuse, but certainly not if one is referring to narcotics.  As many Americans died from drug overdoses in the last 24 years as have died in all our wars?  1.3 million Americans have died in all our wars while opioid deaths totaled about 700 thousand since 1999, only one half of what Janeen alleges.

So I've always acted as if I had the capacity for addiction, and I believe it was the right thing to do. If my initial cravings for, by way of example, a pain killer prescribed after surgery are a measure. I was right to do so. \n\nI have no doubt that addiction is real. That some substances change the chemistry of your body to turn something deemed necessary (like hydrocodone) or seemingly innocuous (like alcohol or, to a lesser extent, tobacco) can change the chemistry of your body or brain and make them a necessity. That's addiction, and I know from first-hand observation how difficult it is to reverse. Addicts need all the help they can get, the first of which is to head off addiction before it begins. The last is, never give up on them. Even if they remain clean and sober for even a few weeks or months at a time, the effort is worth it.",

There are many opinions, pundits,  and countless articles about addiction, or as is termed now, substance use disorder. Let\u2019s talk about the real world. Our son did not choose addiction. He did as many of you might, experimented. The difference his brain and body craved the next high. Personal responsibility? Our son worked to stop, 8 rehabs, years of counseling, medications to help stop. AA, NA? Tried and failed. When you are young the immaturity and feeling of invincibility can overwhelm reality, even when reality is killing you.\n\nThe courts tried to help.

Just when we truly believed success was here we get a call from the NYPD, dead in a Brooklyn SRO, our last sight of him lying on a gurney after an autopsy we didn\u2019t want. He suffered enough. We knew the cause of death. Want to talk about rock bottom?\n\nWe walked the halls of Congress for legislative help.

        "Two things can be true at once. Yes, addiction treatment in our country is wildly inadequate AND time spent in rehab is never wasted. Relapse is part of recovery. \n\nAfter brutal years of walking my son down the recovery road, I can testify that we are not losing the worst of us to drugs, we are losing the best of us--the creative, the intelligent, the ones exquisitely sensitive to the pain in this world. In their thwarted attempts to escape the beast, they drive themselves deeper into its belly. Still, my son, on the worst day of his addiction, was a better human than most humans I have known.  \n\nAn opioid prescription after a car wreck cast my teenage son down the dark rabbit hole. It took him several tries on the rehab merry-go-round before he discovered he can't touch the stove anywhere. It's hot all over. He is thriving now and committed to living \"happy, joyous, and free.\" \n\nMy son has the heart of a lion and one stubborn mom, and that's why he is still alive. Once I abandoned the deadly myth of \"tough love\" and walked toward the monster with him, instead practicing \"unyielding love\" and setting healthy boundaries, he grew stronger. When we get better, they get better. Long-term treatment, MAT, care, and support are key to overcoming an opioid use disorder. \n\nIf your loved one does finally break the chains of chemical slavery, please know you love and support someone who is remarkably courageous. As long as breath is in their body, there is hope.",

I get not wanting to be in chronic pain and that is a whole other ball game different from starting drugs (and that includes alcohol and cigarettes) to change how one feels or just to try and be happy and connect with others.  Let's take a look at our culture and what is driving the need to numb and self medicate.   One last word: Two weeks inpatient is not going to cut it.  Insurance companies need to get real about the length of time it takes for a person to successfully recover.",

But outside of where drugs are prescribed by a physician, there was a conscious choice to take them. From the time I was a child I was educated on the perils of drugs. My family and I have all been prescribed opioids for pain in the past. We took them very sparingly, if at all. There are many awful stories where people are sadly under-educated about the dangers of these drugs and become addicted via prescribed medications. But there are many more where taking the drugs after procuring them illegally, is a CHOICE. It is time people in this country take responsibility for their lives.

I prescribe medications like buprenorphine (Suboxone) and naltrexone pretty frequently. \n\nMost PCPs do not currently treat patients for substance use disorders. It's not that they don't want to. There are 2 things standing in their way:\n\n1. Lack of training in medical school and residency about substance use disorders. There has been marked improvement in this over the past few years, but there is still a long way to go. \n\n2. Our current healthcare 'system' is not designed for this. PCPs are overburdened with way too much paperwork and menial tasks that take away from actual patient care. Much of that comes from the insurance industry denying care and denying payments. For PCPs, this means more time dealing with prior authorizations (PAs) and similar tasks. Adding one more thing (taking care of patients with SUDs) just feels too much for them right now. \n\nTo fix #2, we need an improved Medicare for All system (aka a Single Payer system), which would take the paperwork and allow us to do more patient care -- which must of us want to do!",

Insurance may pay for 28 days if a Social Worker can justify it. Insurance companies want a person \"fixed\" within a predictable time frame.\nThe majority of addicts have no insurance and end up on the street or in jail.\nAs with mental health and homeless issues, every outreach or treatment demands money - for workers, physicians, sober living homes, inpatient and outpatient and aftercare followup.\nIt's easy for The NYT to critique what should be done and what is lacking, but the reality is that AA and NA are the only free options for addicts.

There is a massive difference between opioid addiction after medically necessary fentanyl IVs or opioid treatments and the more common addiction of personal drug use.  Self esteem, life purpose, positive attitude, a willingness to do better, inner strength, connection to others, helping others, taking personal responsibility - this HAS to be part of the common addicts recovery.

I've heard that the opioid blockers or substitutes are having enormous success but are technically opioids themselves and are heavily regulated in some states. My own experience in treatment, with individuals willing and very much wanting to quit in a residential setting with good standards of care, still had a 90% relapse rate within 12 months of finishing the program. I was in a transition house for 10 months... it was a magnificent place, a mansion donated to the city for housing recovering alcoholics by a wealthy benefactor with 12 rooms, big stone fireplace (was an old hunting lodge). 3 meals a day and onsite counselling daily, individual counselling, medication distribution.  Of the 80 people that rotated through during my time there, me and one other person were the only ones not to relapse.  Of the people who relapsed, a large number did so temporarily but got back on track... an even larger number went back to using fulltime again. This did build a system of sorts that expected failure, counsellors who constantly suspected clients were using and a wall of sorts between staff and patients by staff who were constantly disappointed and bitter. Rules were set up organically to separate those likely to relapse, curfews and other responsibilities that would push out those likely to relapse and leave only the very determined.",

They say that blaming legitimate prescription drugs is often just an excuse to pass the buck from irresponsible behavior.\n\nWe have to ask hard and honest questions about how people get addicted in the first place and what can be done to prevent it.  Another hard question we must ask is if some addicts actually don't want to get clean.\n\nHow many drug addicts began using to self-medicate untreated mental illness?  Years ago the state mental hospitals were closed.  We need much better mental health care, and maybe that might reduce drug use.\n\nSome school districts use dogs to search students for narcotics.  Teachers in affluent districts say drug use is rampant, even in middle school.  If that is true, we have to ask ourselves why that is.  Are kids so stressed out that turn to drugs?  Are kids so bored they turned to drugs for recreation or to be cool?\n\nI doubt anyone who starts taking drugs expects to turn out as an addict living in misery on the streets.  I suspect they assume they'll be able to handle it.\n\nSadly, our society had justified drug abuse.  Our TV and film jokes about it, or minimizes the consequences. \n\nLong ago Nancy Reagan suggested the \"Just Say No\" campaign.  This was widely mocked.  But was the idea really bad?",

As a psychologist specializing in addictive disorders, I realize that one of the biggest obstacles, and one hardest to overcome, is generalized stigma among both the lay population and within the helping professions. This stigma is exacerbated by a striking lack of training for health-care professionals, which can be rectified more readily than the stigma of addiction as a personality disorder or a moral failure. \n\nTwo nits to pick: \nThe focus of this piece is understandably on opiates. Often ignored is the far larger number of people who are affected by alcohol. Death rates from alcohol exceed opiate deaths by a significant margin.\n \nThe second nit is the subtle disparagement of 12-Step programs, which can be quite effective (a recent Cochrane report solidly demonstrates this). While there is some truth that some AA/NA groups discourage the use of buprenorphine and methadone, this is slowly changing, and should be encouraged everywhere. And data showing the effectiveness of AA, and addiction treatment in general, should be promulgated among the helping professionals, and in society in general.",

I have a thought I'd like to share, albeit a single data point, an unusual one, since no street drugs (i.e. uncertainty) were ever involved. \n\n\"Trading one addiction for another is what they call it,\" quoting Mr. Davis. \n\nI have to agree. In 2010 I sustained a three column burst fracture in the T-12 vertebrae. I was immediately placed on IV fentanyl in the hospital, then graduated to a patch after leaving orthopedic rehab in a full-horse (clamshell) brace. Unfortunately my bones didn't heal, and I was put on a study drug, which forced healing over a two year period. Once healing was complete, the pain was from a \"non-union,\" easily corrected by injecting bone cement. Just like that, my physical pain was over, now came the arduous task of getting off fentanyl. \n\n My insurance would cover just one week in drug rehab, and was immediately put on buprenorphine. Right away I was extremely euphoric, something I'd never experienced with fentanyl. Without a clone who didn't get buprenorphine, I can't know how things would have gone without, but after leaving a week later,  I was in agony with severe withdrawal symptoms. I didn't pursue additional suboxone treatment, since the reason I wanted off fentanyl is that my pain was cured with surgery and I didn't like who I was on it. More suboxone would be, as Mr. Davis said, training one addiction for another. I got though it, but would have rather used other medicines to combat side effects. Best to all.",

BUT that is by far not the only solution.  I have been sober 33 years, and have watched numerous people die who weren\u2019t able to stay clean, for a variety of reasons.  It is heart breaking.  I love the fact that this article includes so many approaches.\n\nOne of the reasons any program of recovery works is that it is based on connecting with others.  The simple fact of neurology is that brains heal brains.   Connection with others is key.  Whatever people can find is good.   AA was started by a bunch of men in the 1930\u2019s.  We need different, more open ways of creating this connection.  I am also a therapist and have been working in the field for over 29 years.  There is a rather simple concept that treatment often misses.  Addiction memories are stored as positive.  As such, the usual ways of processing negative memories don\u2019t work.  You treat the addiction memory as a positive and then you are able to unlink the association between the drug and the positive memory. \n\nFinally, treatment centers have not been working.  A recent lawsuit against a drug company resulted in a billion dollar settlement, and much of that was funneled into existing treatment programs.  These programs exist to make a profit.  This may sound cynical, but if people get clean and stay clean then the profits dry up.",

That one teen will want the feeling again and even if they know it\u2019s wrong, their brain is saying that was too good to pass up.  The inevitable consequences don\u2019t dampen the craving.  Ignoring biology allows us to pretend their addiction is their fault, that their moral failings are the reason they and their families are in disarray and suffering.  Punishing people for bad decisions that lead to addiction and further degrade their lives, and those of the people around them, is not what a caring society should condone.  The science is there to improve their lives and arguments about the cost to help usually ignore the costs of not helping.

Second, the author might mention that it is not simply \u201claw enforcement vs medical\u201d that are at odds here.  Many want to address social factors and \u201croot causes,\u201d rather than focus on the patient themselves.  Third, as a society, we have conflicting policies - injection sites, alcohol, gambling, mushrooms, cannabinoids and tobacco?  Check.  Everything else, not so much.  Finally, mandatory treatment is still frowned upon.  Given all of these issues, even if we found a \u201ccure\u201d for whatever, our fractured views of addiction would prevent its deployment.",

        "This excellent  article does state that we need to regulate addiction providers, but I would like to underscore that need.  In my long experience trying to help my addicted daughter, I found insurance would cover 28 day rehabs (once Obama health care reforms were passed) .  But everyone knows it is rare, probably never happened, that a person is suddenly cured after 28 days.   Because money for rehabs opened up after Obama care, charlatans flocked to the field. Yes, on paper many offer follow up. In reality, most don\u2019t. Also the follow up is not covered by insurance.  We need better follow up care than telling people to go to AA. \n\nIt may be that an older person who lived a largely functional life and got addicted through prescriptions can come out the other side with 28 days plus AA or Smart Recovery, but not those who started young. \n\nThe other fact I would like to point out is that EVERY GIRL in my daughter\u2019 s  rehabs had been raped. Want to lower addiction rates? Stop sexual assault.",

        "Special thanks to the New York Times for their continual work to unravel the problems of addiction.  \n\nThe big point, that addiction should be treated as a medical issue, not a crime, is correct.  There was no mention of Portugal, which has gone from leading Europe in overdose deaths, to one of the lowest in deaths.  They did it by making opiates almost legal and easy to get, but require counseling to get and can't be consumed in public.  By controlling what they get, unknown stronger doses that kill people are eliminated.  Pretty simple.\n\nThe elephant in the addiction room, of course, is alcohol.  Not much mention of it, either.  The collateral damage and death numbers of alcohol far surpass opiates, but alcohol is our national drug.  One of the big mysteries of the universe is how alcohol has escaped the \"drug\" label it most certainly owns.  As the most \n\"dis-inhibiting drug\", it turns some users into out of control maniacs.  we've all seen it many times.  However, Jesus turned water into wine as his first miracle, and said there is wine in heaven, etc. etc.  Do you think most priests and judges enjoy a glass of good wine after a hard day's work?\n\nAlcohol is promoted as the a key to the good life.  Alcohol is the most expensive, and hardest addictive drug to kick, and the only drug where a senior withdrawing can die if not going through detox.   I know this because my brother went through it twice, had all kinds of help, but couldn't stop drinking, and took his own life.",

NY requires all doctors take opioid course regardless of specialty. It\u2019s not going to make radiologists start treating addiction during a mammogram. Or neonatologists or pathologists. So politicians feel like they\u2019re doing something and it costs money best spent elsewhere. Follow the money and you will see large medical groups run by hedge funds and none have mental health workers. They do have an eyeglass shop! To make addiction treatment a priority, you\u2019re going to need to change a lot more than mandating doctors to take a course every year, You will need to change how healthcare in this country. City and county hospitals are dumping grounds for patients that are more difficult to treat whether it be addiction or complex medical care due to disability or rare genetic disorders. These patients take time and cost a lot to care for when insurance either doesn\u2019t pay or pays very little. Where are the social workers? Not at the fancy medical office where the cardiologists and oncologists work. Until we have universal healthcare so one specialist is not paid 3 or 4 times what another specialist is paid, no med student with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans (another part of the problem) is going to choose addiction medicine.",

(I am familiar with Joan Larson's work, but hopefully there is a vast amount of published material and training available on this topic.)  Drug abuse depletes the body of amino acids that are required for proper neurotransmitter functioning, and so the person becomes dependent on the drug to not feel terrible.  Building back up the natural stores of amino acids is the key to getting the neurotransmitters to function normally again so that the patient feels normal so that they don't need the drug anymore.  Examples of amino acids:  tryptophan or 5HTP to build back up serotonin; DPA (D-Phenylalanine) to build back up endorphins; tyrosine to build back up dopamine, and GABA to build back up GABA.  Amino acids are inexpensive and go to the root of the problem rather than masking the problem.  Once the person is feeling better, they will have a much easier time in therapies and making whatever efforts are required of them.",

If I get high and drive my car through a crowd of people, being under the influence is not relevant. I should be punished for the recklessness that resulted in injuring or killing someone. Period. \n\nI hold the same point of view in relation to noncompliant individuals with mental health issues.\n\nWe are evolving into a society that is inconsistent, at best, with holding people accountable. If I choose to use mind and mood altering substances, the behaviors that follow can be unpredictable. However, the choice to take the gamble should be my cross to bear.\n\nOn an aside, the silliness of January 6th reflects hypocrisy and inconsistencies in our legal and political systems toward the Insurrectionists. Even if it was an unauthorized tour group, there needs to be  accountability. I have no doubt many of them are either mentally unbalanced, substance abusers past or present, and/or criminals.

        "Addiction is dreadful.  And the case is well made for better medical treatment.  What is not addressed in the article is behavior.  As anyone knows who has dealt with addicts, there can be a raft of repugnant, manipulative and even violent behaviors that accompany the medical issue.  Lying, stealing, repeated promises to change, only to be broken.  These accompanying realities contribute to the strict, almost unbending rules are placed in treatment centers.  The shame addicts experience is as much about those behaviors as the substance abuse itself.  Addiction is more than a medical matter it's a systemic illness, social as well as spiritual however anyone would define that.  \n\n I would also encourage the Times to do a second piece on prevention of addiction.  Consider \"recreational\" drug use that supposedly does no harm to anyone, but funds the cartels and gangs that distribute.  The loneliness epidemic.  The culture of alcohol consumptions to \"take the edge off\" whatever is a stressful reality.  Not to mention, the pain management reality of our medical community, and our overall proclivity to \"take a pill\" to address an issue rather than consider behavioral change.",

        "Constantly overlook is that these scourges are a BUSINESS. There are profit makers at the root of illegal drug use and distribution, and they are making millions tearing to shreds the social fabric of our society. Like any high-profit business it is self-sustaining via the hard work of it's entrepreneurs ie dealers. The cycle is dealer to new user/customer, who transitions to perfect customer (an addict) who enriches the dealer. \n\nIt is not the addict who is the main victim of this cycle, it is the new user, who falls out of the working or scholastic life to a life that revolves around getting and using the drug. The illegal drug sales & distribution cycle needs to be broken, if new users are to be directed away from addiction. Helping addicts is a separate medical issue that should be accomplished by replacing dealers, who do not care about humanity, with professionals, who do. And addicts have to help, because they have the secret knowledge on dealers. When is the last time anyone heard of an addict turning in their dealers? This should be required.\n\nAddicts should be prescribed the illegal chemicals that they cannot live without and also put on rehab paths. When they fail their rehab path they would thus fall back on caring professionals not dealers. In exchange for that support addicts should and must turn in dealers, who should go to jail. This process replaces the inhuman dealer with the humane professional, who will not because of ethics provide drugs to new users.",

Many homeless individuals, of which many of them were clearly suffering from severe mental illness, but no one cares for them. Many were doing drugs and using needles openly on the street and the police were just indifferent. Well meaning organisations that supply clean needles and paraphernalia to prevent harm are actually enabling drug abuse. We need drug arrests and court ordered mandatory residential center treatments followed by regular check to make sure they have not fallen back on old habits (like how criminal justice system uses probation). ABC  news reported that federal employees have been told to work from home amid the crime and drug use outside of their building in the San Francisco. Recently, Nordstrom closed its flagship SF store. \n\nWe could invest billions into treatment programs, but nothing will change if we continue with a laissez-faire approach to open drug use that many cities have adopted. This is bad for vitality and safety of cities as the case from SF shows, but also bad for people who are addicted to drugs. We are condemning them to early death and poor quality of life by not forcibly removing them from the streets and sending them to treatment centers.",

        "Buprenorphine saved my young niece's life, but only after her family abandoned her to the streets and I took her in, after she relapsed on multiple cold-turkey programs, and a short stint in jail which led to a court mandated program. But she didn't really clean up until I insisted that her mother get her into a program that administered the medication. Six years later she has a four-year-old daughter who's thriving and she has her master's degree in behavioral child psychology. She was lucky, we had the health care resources to get her treatment, and she had family that still clearly cared about her. But almost everything we did for her could be easily replicated if people understood what is happening to addicts instead of this Puritan insistence on this disease as personal failings. She showed me a film called Unwoven Pleasure which recasts addiction as a disease. I recommend it to anyone seeking to understand.",
