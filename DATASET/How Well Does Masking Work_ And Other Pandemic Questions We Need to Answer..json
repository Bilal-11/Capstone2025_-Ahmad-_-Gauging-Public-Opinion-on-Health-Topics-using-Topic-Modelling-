        "Do masks help? If they don\u2019t, infectious disease docs who have been wearing them in hospitals and pandemic hot zones for a century must be crazy to bother. \n\nSpoiler alert: they\u2019re not. \n\nSome cultures \u2014 like ours \u2014 simply hate masks and associate them with outlaws, klansmen and executioners. Other cultures \u2014 like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 have no problem with covering their faces. In Japan, people actually prefer to. They routinely used folding fans toward that end before modern style face masks appeared there during the 1918 flu pandemic. And they never stopped masking. \n\nNow comes covid, and among masking nations, other medical assets being similar, their per capita death rates are a small fraction of ours. \n\nHow small? The US covid death rate per capita is about 3300 per million population, the 19th worst in the world, slightly worse even than Britain and Brazil. Shameful for the world\u2019s most scientifically pre-eminent nation. But the Japanese covid death rate is only about 600 per million, more than 5 times better than our results. South Korea and Taiwan, also habitual maskers, had similarly low covid death rates. \n\nBottom line: if we had done as well as Japan, our total covid deaths would be about 200,000, not 1.1 million. Almost a million American lives would have been saved. \n\nMasking works. But only if you actually use them.",
        "What the heck does \"interventions\" even mean. Plus obviously not a controled scientific study. You could actually do a true study but no one has.",
        "New York City was the epicenter of the national outbreak of the coronavirus and mpox.\n\n\"Travel From New York City Seeded Wave of U.S. Outbreaks\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in New York City became the primary source of infections around the United States, researchers have found.\"\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html</a>\n\nWe saw the same thing with HIV and LA.\n\nRepublicans are usually slower to react to wearing masks and using precautions.  It usually takes 2-3 months for traveling salesmen and politicians running for election to travel to the vertical concrete dwellers to catch diseases from the fly over people and spread them to flown over people.\n\nThis is why we need to start the response using facts and science.  Trolls and antagonists that try to inject race, religion, gender or politics into the discussion, to induce irrelevant \"facts\", stereotypes and conspiracy theories to derail intelligent discourse, need to be excluded from the process.",
        "Jeez, 3 years and a million dead Americans later, we still have no societal will for the greater good. Our public health authorities went from being completely ignored pre-pandemic to becoming pariahs, and now back to being ignored. And we go back to pursuing our own individual desires...",
        "Absolutely.\n\nBut Republicans focus money on \u201cdefense.\u201d\n\nAlso if politicians, lawyers and MD\u2019s had asked biophysicists or aerosol scientists how long tiny droplets hang in the air \u2014 hours to days \u2014 they would have learned sooner that transmission was airborne.   \n\nAnd why didn\u2019t officials say that wearing masks outdoors was silly?\n\nAnd why don\u2019t they explain the differences between cloth, N95 and N99 masks?",
        "Kate McKinnon on a SNL skit during the covid mask paranoia, girls gymnastic tournament, all wore masks.  Then afterward, all the girls had a pizza party, no mask.  How did a mask mandate help ?  when I have posted this in the past, the response I have received is we needed to stop pizza parties for girl gymnastics.",
        "\"But we should have put into place efforts to rapidly collect and assess high-quality data...\"\n\nWell, why didn't you?  This is an egregious failure of public health.  Now you want more funding?  There was trillions of dollars spent on this pandemic already, and you don't even really know if masks work or not with a pandemic raging all around you.  That's simply nuts.  You don't even know what proportion of infections are from aerosols.  Why have we not seen further variants after omicron?  You don't have a clue.  I could go on.\n\nWhat I learned over the past few years is how little actionable intelligence public health actually has about infections and their transmission.  I will be relying on that learned lack of knowledge going forward when I decide whether to trust authoritative pronouncements from this area of science in the future.",
        "I wish public influencers like Bill Maher would stop making declarations such as \"We now know that masks don't work at all.\"",
        "There seems to be this blind devotion to masking that borders on religious.\n\nIn blue cities, mask compliance was virtually 100% during the pandemic. Yet our transmission levels were always the same as the red cities in which masks were a rarity.\n\nThey just didn't work. Why is that so hard to admit?",
        "Thank you. This is infinitely better than Leona Wen's take in the Post. The various scenarios and difficulties in assessing most of them plainly laid out. \n\nAs for me, I haven't been in a crowded or indoor public space without a tightly fitted N95 in years, I don't hang around in them routinely or for very long periods of time anyway, and so far I haven't had covid.",
        "Assuming that \u201cmasking works\u201d is a given, we need to know how well it works. To use contraception as an analogy, is masking like the pull-out method (better than nothing but hard to consistently do perfectly and therefore shouldn\u2019t be encouraged if other, more effective methods exist), condoms (not the best but reasonable and a nice extra bit of security for those who want it) or IUDs (gold standard, nothing else needed)\n\nTo me it is clear that masking is not an IUD. So is it a condom (works well enough to recommend as an additive for extra safety) or is it pulling out (so low value that it only is recommended in the absence of all other methods).",
        "Anyone who can google can look up the number of people died from the flu in 2021/2022 and the years before. Anyone who can read can see that the number in the 2021/2022 winter was dramatically lower than ever before. And here we are still discussing the effectiveness of distancing and masking? Claiming more research is needed?\n\nLook at the numbers by state. In Florida about 80,000 people more died of COVID than there would have been had Florida had the same death rate as Oregon. Oregon's governor Kate Brown did an excellent job, in close cooperation with schools and businesses, keeping the casualties of COVID to a minimum. This included mandatory masking.\n\nEighty thousand people. If you want to investigate something, start there.",
        "Masks are simply basic risk management. Surgical or N95 will block incoming and outgoing particles if used correctly. Hence all of the team at my upcoming surgery will be masked. Wearing a mask for a visit to the store or elsewhere was a minimal inconvenience. So why not mitigate risk? Part of the problem is the pushing of Libertarian and purely individualistic views that are pretty much a way to say my freedom is more important than anyone else. Which led to ill considered points of view and actions. If a person was not masked and encroached on me I simply told them to get away and the look in my eyes said it all and they backed off quickly.",
        "Works for individual people is the key.  Aged people, immunocompromised people, medical people easily come to mind.  The paradox of retirement comes to mind.  Individuals can retire, many individuals can retire in certain places, but everyone in a society may not.  If everyone retires,  then there is no one to harvest food, transport fuel, or create insipid political ads.  Everyone may not need or benefit from masking up against COVID, but many individuals always will.",
        "I wear a mask in public indoor spaces like supermarkets and other crowded areas. All I can say is I never got covid and haven't had a cold either since December 2019. I don't miss having colds or sinus infections so I'll keep masking.",
        "At no point\u2026not one\u2026during the past three years, or more, was there any indication whatsoever that wearing a mask alone would significantly reduce anyone\u2019s likelihood of infection. The fact that anyone interpreted any one precautionary measure, not just face covering, to be fail safe if not sure was, has been, and will always be worse than wishful thinking.",
        "All I can say, from personal experience, is that for me masks work.\nI am one of the lucky ones who has not contracted any virus, COVID or flu. I wear a mask still today every time I go into a drugstore (usually sick people there) and supermarkets (too many people in enclosed environment). But in 2023 I'm not as vigilant as I was in the previous 2 years.\nDo masks work? For me, YES.",
        "Interesting and befuddling, trying to validate randomized trials about the need and value of common sense ideas...if acted upon the right way. All of the data thus far are incomplete at best but worth considering for future endeavors. Given how little we really know, a heavy dose of humility ought to be installed in our minds, and our trust that public health institutions shall use preventive measures...as we speak. Questions and disagreements out there? Of course. As long as they won't paralize our thoughts...nor the funds necessary to gain some control of a plague we remain susceptible to. And, lest we forget, we must fight, 'tooth and nail', the irrational potential of politicking a health issue (as Trumpian republicans have done in the not too distant past).",
        "Hey, I hate wearing a mask when going about most of my daily life. It is generally uncomfortable and to those who suggest it is not an impediment to social interaction, I beg to differ. As a teacher I am so ecstatic not to wear one, and even more pleased that most of my students don't choose to. The exchange of information is just different. \n\nAll that being said, I will definitely be ready and willing to do as science (and really common sense) demands when the next serious viral threat emerges. Of course masks are effective when used properly. I am behind the concept completely. And I'm also behind the the thesis of this article. We need to prepare for what is surely on the horizon and having solid scientific data will be the best way to persuade a reluctant populace of the need for social mandates of any kind. \n\nMeanwhile, we should acknowledge that daily continuous masking is no fun and should not be mandated unless necessary.",
        "Good points. But I find some very poorly worded questions in the following:\n\u201cThe pertinent question isn\u2019t whether masks work but why \u200c\u200cmasking didn\u2019t prove to be highly effective in the most rigorous studies. Was it because adherence to masking, not the masks themselves, was the problem? Is it because the population studied\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c wore masks when around infected people but then got infected from family members?\u201d\n\nQuestions rewritten to make sense (to me at least):\nWas it because LACK OF adherence to masking, not the masks themselves, was the problem? Is it because the population studied\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c wore masks when around SYMPTOMATIC people but then got infected from family members?",
        "Every single person I know who wore a mask religiously (and accurately) contracted COVID-19, including healthcare professionals who were accustomed to wearing masks that were properly fitted and fit-tested. The virus is nearly impossible to stop with masks. It probably works sometimes, but it isn't a reliable or effective healthcare device with respect to a virus as contagious as COVID-19.",
        "Remember the phrase, \"flatten the curve.\" I actually think masks helped do just that. Covid is so infectious it will eventually infect everyone. Masks helped slow that progress until we had effective vaccines and treatments. At a population level, will everyone get covid? Yes, but masks helped make it that much slower and for that reason will continue to be an important and effective public health measure when the next pandemic strikes.",
        "Did Dr. Nuzzo even read the Cochrane study? First of all, almost all the studies used in the Cochrane metanalysis asked a different question; How complaint were subjects in using masks in the different survey studies incorporated into the met-analysis? That is a very different question than how efficacious are masks or other interventions (e.g., hand washing) in preventing infection.\n\nSecondly, almost all the studies used in the Cochrane meta-analysis involved influenza and not SARS-CoV-2 virus. These are very different viruses. Influenza has an R0 (basic reproduction #) of 1-2. The original SARS-CoV-2 virus R0 was 3.3. The Omicron sub variant BA.5 is R0 18.6, equivalent to measles, the most contagious human virus.\n\nFinally, after the latest Cochrane study was released, the head of the Cochrane Library distanced itself from the study because the study\u2019s author misled the press in saying masks don\u2019t work. The truth is that the Cochrane study didn\u2019t ask about the efficacy of mask wearing in preventing infection, but instead asking the efficacy of how often subjects were compliant in using masks when instructed to do so.\n\nThere have been no good studies on masks.",
        "A hypothetical history of the Cochrane Review paper; Jefferson (the first author) had obviously been preparing this review, the product of a lot of time and effort and presumably high profile in the profession, for several years prior to 2020; and was just about ready to publish when COVID hit and raised the important question of how to defend against this new disease, which obviously impacted his existing review.\nThe review clearly shows Jefferson's conviction that masking was not helpful in the papers he reviewed, which involve influenza and common cold and similar diseases, prior to 2020 (and some techniques other than masking, for instance gargling). To be useful and topical (and worth publishing in the new emergency), the review would need updating to address the new virus, given that everyone could see that the virus was unrelated to influenza, and the manner and timeline of its infectivity were very different.\nBut it's notable here that Jefferson's first publication in regard to COVID in early 2020 reached the tentative conclusion that it was NOT actually a separate disease, but merely an aberrant timing of the influenza season. If true, this would have meant his review would need minimal change. \nThis proving not to be the case, however, studies of effectiveness of defenses against Covid would need to be added to the paper. The two available didn't directly counter the influenza results, but did punch a hole in the larger idea of the uselessness of masking. And so...",
        "I used to teach industrial safety.  To be effective a paper mask must be an N95 or higher, on a clean shaven face, worn over the nose, and adjusted such that there are no leaks.  As mentioned it is only worn once.  Most people are not willing to follow such a strict protocol.",
        "still today, we have people wearing masks all the time including while walking along outside.  How is that \"following the science\" ?",
        "So, we can study masks all day, but sometimes a little common sense is in order.  Even in places where mask compliance was high, many, many people were still eating in restaurants, where the charade of masking while walking to your table, only to sit unmasked for an hour or two in an enclosed space, likely negated a good bit if not most of the mask benefit at the population level.  If you mask for ten hours a day in public, but then go to a restaurant, it\u2019s possible you just wiped out all the benefit of masking.  We all did this knowing it was stupid, partly because we all clung to the idea that droplets only travelled a few feet, even after it became obvious that was not the case.  We are just a dumb species. That\u2019s the basic problem.",
        "Also, below many are using the \"surgeons wear them\" canard. Surgeons have someone in gloves tightly tie the mask on. Surgeons don't touch the mask without a glove, or if they do they immediately dispose of it and get another one. Surgeons change masks often and never never never reuse them. \n\nWhile I'm sure only \"MAGA Republicans\" and other troglodytes miswore their masks, and that all below were as diligent as a heart surgeon with their masks.",
        "Lord, are we still on this topic? Make it stop. No amount of studies, common sense or anything is going to change anyone\u2019s minds at this point. Everyone is dug in on  this and every other topic in this country. Wear masks if you want to, I do. Don\u2019t wear them if you don\u2019t care about yourself or others.",
        "No one seems to remember, or want to, that the CDC recommended /against/ general mask-wearing for the first month or so of the pandemic.  \u201cFacemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers,\u201d they said (3/24/2020).\nNothing wrong with /that;/ keeping the medical community alive, up, and functioning is likely the best use of PPE to improve overall community health.\nBut sometimes that message turned into \u201c[Masks] are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus,\u201d (Surgeon General Jerome Adams, 2/29/2020), which was simply wrong.\nAlthough the tune had changed by April 2020, it proved politically impossible for anyone to bluntly say \"We were wrong,\" and serious damage was done.",
        "Uh, at the risk of mentioning reality, a couple things. \n\n1. That Cochrane study said absolutely zip about mandates. It looked at attempts to study how well various, \u201cinterventions,\u201d including masking, worked to protect populations and individuals. Their general conclusion was that NONE of the studies were very useful: the data was so messy that you couldn\u2019t do much with it, and we need better studies.\n\n2. \u201cIntervention,\u201d is not a synonym for, \u201cmandate.\u201d In this context, it simply means that something got between the virus and people. All it means, guys. \n\n3. The study is in this excellent op-ed to help support Dr. Nucci\u2019s basic point: a lot of our prob with figuring out how to handle this oandemic is that for various reasons, we just weren\u2019t getting very good data on interventions such as masking. (In fact, a lot of early policy was based on the assumption that covid would, \u201cbehave,\u201d just like colds and the flu. That\u2019s a primary reason why CDC\u2019s advice changed.)\n\n4. She\u2019s arguing that we should get set up better for the next time the circus comes to town.\n\n5. Special bonus reality bit: from what she\u2019s saying about past studies, the only rational attitude to take with regard to interventions such as masking is agnosticism, a word that literally translates out as, \u201cdunnoism.\u201d Best guess is, good masks worn well do a good job of protection. \n\nBut like Dr. Zinsky says in, \u201cThe Core,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all science is\u2026best guess.\u201d \n\nIt would be nice to do better than we did.",
        "Happy to see the Times writing thoughtful balanced articles is is usual (though not always of course).  But again disappointed by the general tenor of the comments which are more about saying how stupid, awful other people are than thoughtful balanced responses.  I and my spouse wore N95 masks from a reliable supplier (3M) from the Feb. 2020 until now and did not get covid though my spouse did recently. But (1) they are highly helpful but NOT perfect (2) for many reasons some have not worn them consistently (or at all).  And indeed the study was about mandates as some have pointed out.  To improve we need understanding and caring for those who differ from our conclusions, not attacks",
        "Dr. Nuzzo if you have to have surgery and I sincerely hope you don't, tell the OR staff they do not have wear their masks for your surgery. Forgive me for being snarky but I am sick of hearing these arguments especially coming out of a physician's mouth. Mask work, period.\n\nRetired OR Pharmacist",
        "I wonder if umbrellas work when it rains.",
        "When the pandemic started and I was required to quarantine, I read several books about the 1918 flu.  I learned a lot and it helped put this pandemic into perspective.  Sadly, a lot of people and governments at all levels repeated the stupidity of the 1918 flu.  People refused to mask, people insisted on going to places where it was crowded indoors, people insisted on their right to visit care homes and brought Covid with them, causing deathly outbreaks in those care homes.  School children brought the virus home with them, especially in the early days when there were no vaccines for children and youth.  The often conflicting information from the experts confused people and critics of mitigation efforts capitalised on this and confused everyone further.  In my opinion, too many individuals bought into the anti-vax, anti-mask baloney.  It seemed that individual \"rights\" superseded collective rights.  I am left disappointed by the behaviour of society in general.  Instead of getting vaccinated and wearing a mask and not congregating in settings where transmission was likely, we chose to let the vulnerable die and played roulette with the health of our school-age children.  I am so ashamed.  We have learned nothing, it seems.  We can't even respect the opinions and knowledge of the medical experts!  How sad.",
        "If you think masks don't work, next time you have surgery, be sure to let your surgeon know that he or she can go ahead and operate on you without a mask.",
        "When worn by most people, and worn *correctly* (over the nose), they work. But masks were politicized in our country, and people selfishly chose not to wear them, not to wear them properly, or not to get vaccinated and wear them at all. The politicization of mask-wearing from the onset, by Trump and his followers, doomed our collective attempts. Americans have become an immature and narcissistic bunch \u2014 \u201cme first, community last.\u201d God forbid you think of others first, right?",
        "The Cochrane review is, to date, the most comprehensive meta-analysis regarding masking that has been conducted.  The findings are what they are.  The authors, clearly finding the conclusions conflicting with their own beliefs, indulge in a post-hoc road trip seeking to \u201cexplain the findings.\u201d  As my old medical school professor once said to me when I didn\u2019t agree with the findings in a paper of his \u201cThose are my data, when you get your own, give me a call.\u201d",
        "One of the biggest flaws of the Cochrane study is that most of the mask studies it examined mixed effective N95 masks with other virtually useless ones, and that none of the studies required users to wear their masks in all public situations and verified if they were doing so.\n\nA good N95 mask is incredibly effective at preventing infection. It is not effective if you don\u2019t wear it, or wear one with holes in it, or wear it without covering your nose. Therefore, it\u2019s not effective for that part of the population that wears one incorrectly\u2014which should seem obvious, but wasn\u2019t by those conducting the Cochrane study.",
        "when covid was at its most dangerous, pre vaxx,   i like everyone wore ill fitting cloth masks in stores on buses etc.  All the time for months.  Never got it.  Virtually everyone i know since who has been masked with N-95s etc constantly got covid.  It is baffling...",
        "After 3 years, the only time I got COVID was just recently, after seeing a broadway show, unmasked.  That includes while caring for a COVID positive son at home, in close quarters, while masked. For me, notwithstanding the braying of the \u201cCOVID is nothing\u201d crew, COVID was not mild. So I will resume masking in crowded locales and let people think what they may.",
        "I believe 100% N95 masks work against any airborne virus. \n\nThis is a strictly technical issue; wearing an N95 mask requires learning, and it should comply with other measures. \n\nIf N95 masks do not have any value, then many doctors, nurses, and patient care people in Civid ICU would be dead or seriously ill too.\n\nBut when you are in public, you cannot repeat the same results; Nothing remotely resembles in public and ICU or laboratory environment, let aside any person's comprehension of what air filtering is.\n\nMentioned Cochrane study falls into that trap too.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, In New York and Northern Italy, people are dying like flies, here and there. I witnessed dead bodies piled up in refrigerated trucks. Scenes in My Hospital were surreal, like in Hieronymus Bosch's paint.\n\n\nWhat would be advised then to the general public is to hold their breath in the subway or deeply inhale the virus-laden subway air or  Aircraft fuselage air. \n\nOne thing in medicine used for this purpose was the mask, and that is advised.  \n\nBut we really need to figure out this issue; it was very badly handled at the scientific level but catastrophic at the political level. I blame Trump, not Fauci at all.\n\nOne million Americans shouldn't die from this event; it is seriously disproportional compared to the rest of the world.",
        "\u201cIn Fact, the Science Is Clear That Masks Work,\u201d by Zeynep Tufekci (column, March 11) had it perfectly correct. The Cochrane paper is widely available on the internet for free, and anyone interested can go see the primary source of data, and in fact should do so before having an opinion on this subject.\nAnd what Tufekci said is absolutely correct, with absolutely no chance of misinterpretation; the review includes only 2 papers that address masking and COVID, and both report effectiveness, but at a low level of confidence (typical of observational studies of limited numbers of people, as opposed to big specifically designed clinical trials).\nFor one of the authors to then singlehandedly announce in the nonacademic media that the review concludes with a low or medium (reports have included both) level of confidence that they do NOT work is the same as me weighing myself twice today and getting in each case a reading of a pound or two more than last week, and then concluding with low or moderate confidence that I have not gained any weight in a week. Wishful thinking in complete and naked opposition to simple logic.",
        "The Cochrane Review has some explaining to do about their lead author's blunt assertion that there is no evidence supporting the use of masks. Most infuriating was the fact that the author's own abstract undermined his pronouncement when it acknowledged the many flaws in the studies he and his coauthors reviewed. There have been some studies that support population-based interventions (N Engl J Med 2022;387:1935-46 is one example) that were not considered by the Cochrane Review, but randomized trials relying on this sort of subject compliance will always be hampered by confounders. I am more influenced by something a cardiothoracic surgeon I once worked for used to mutter when confronted by a resident straying into paralysis by analysis: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to use chi-square (a test of statistical significance) on common sense.\u201d Surgeons, in particular, have to make critical decisions in the moment, without the luxury of relying on a randomized trial that bears directly on the question. Occam\u2019s razor is the more useful tool, and here are the known facts: SARS-COV2 is highly communicable and spread by respiratory droplets and sometimes by aerosols. The dispersal of droplets is impeded by physical barriers. While some will infiltrate gaps in a mask or linger to expose those that are unmasked, it is undeniable that a mask will at least attenuate the dose of virus.",
        "I find it difficult to contain my feelings about this question.  As someone whose career was in public health, when Mayor London Breed locked down the Bay Area in March 2020, I immediately bought a box of 10 N-95 masks, among other preparations, and I've worn them in public since.  With a prior history of pneumonia and bronchitis all my life I felt especially vulnerable.  I haven't had a respiratory virus illness since then, and am able to breathe through my nose for the first time I can remember.  \n\nIn April or May 2020, Trump's Surgeon General advised the public that masks were of no use.  Donald Trump and the Republican Party, in the interest of keeping business happening and money flowing, stonewalled denial about Covid 19, and the result was at least 600,000 unnecessary American deaths, mainly of elders (I'm 83).  \n\nIn a country that once valued science and pioneered various successful public health measures, this particular story is shameful beyond belief.  That there's even still a controversy over masking, given what's now widely known about virus aerosol transmission, is simply ridiculous, as is any politicization of health matters, like the Texas Christian judge banning abortion drugs.  \n\nI'll wear a mask in public for the rest of my life.",
        "Be more meticulous. The evidence shows clearly that masks work when used correctly. The evidence also shows masks at the population are not reliably used correctly. What comes next? Asking and answering the question: \"how to we increase the number of people using the masks correctly\"? or concluding a lot of people don't use them correctly, therefore masks don't work?",
        "All I can say is that masks have worked very well for me, because the ones I use are of very high quality and because I wear them correctly (with proper fit).  However, they don't work for most people, because most people don't wear adequate masks and/or don't even come close to wearing them properly.  I once considered this a fixable problem - that these people only needed to be educated about masks and how to wear them.  However, I now consider the problem wholly unfixable.  I have to recognize that I am a rare and glaring exception to the rule that masks don't work, apparently because I care more about my health than anyone else, have a higher tolerance for the mild inconvenience of mask wearing than anyone else, and have the apparently off-the-chart level of intelligence that enables me to understand how to select a good mask and wear it properly.  (When I say \"I,\" I include my partner, whose mask wearing is similar to my own.)\n\nI am a scientist, and therefore an empiricist.  I have concluded the following from my observations:\n\n1. People would rather risk death than to wear anything on their faces, except on Halloween.\n\n2. People are incredibly weak, believing (or saying) that they are unable to breathe with the type of mask that doctors, scientists, house painters, asbestos and lead abatement workers, and others wear on a daily basis.\n\n3. People are apparently incapable of learning from the example of others dying around them.\n\n4. There is no cure for stupidity.",
        "Washing your hands.  We touch billions and billions and billions of germs in a given day left on doorknobs, supermarket baskets, at home or at the office.\n\nThen we touch our mouths and our noses, a habit human beings do without even thinking a couple hundred times a day.  Maybe more.\n\nThere was a reason that, during the pandemic, there were virtually no cases of the flu.  Using soap and water and hand sanitizers kept the germs out of our respiratory tracts.",
        "I'm a respiratory therapist at a local hospital, here in the San Fernando Valley. We had a number of employees, patients and visitors who refused to wear masks. We think of them frequently, and wonder how their families are holding up. We remember the good things about them, and try not to judge their shortened lives by that single  shortcoming in their character. While it's true that most of us grow out of childhood tantrums, stamping our feet \"I won't; you can't make me,\" but not all of us. We miss these folks, and for a time, found their loud gloating \"look at me, I'm just fine,\" was good for a laugh, until it wasn't. And we all hope that, when the next pandemic hits, that the people they left behind don't follow their petulant stupidity.",

Yes some of that was the lockdown.

The translation to the population simply means that implementation is faulty, not that masks don\u2019t work. We have all seen the people who \u201cwear\u201d them under their noses or chins. I watched in some horror as people pulled them down to cough and sneeze and then put them back. It\u2019s no wonder under those circumstances that we still saw the virus spread.",

The authors themselves noted, in the article, that the reason mask MANDATES didn't work in the U.S. was due to \"low compliance.\"  That is, many (stupid) people within mask-mandated areas didn't wear masks - and the result was the (airborne/aerosolization-transmission-vectored) virus continued to spread.  Bottom line of the Cochrane study?  When people don't wear masks, masks don't work.  Duh.",

I shopped at hours when stores weren't crowded and was vaccinated at the earliest possible moment.  I was horrified by the deaths in NYC.  Where I shop now a mask is still required.",
        "So if masks don\u2019t really work, hospitals could stop buying them? And using them in isolation rooms or during surgery where open wounds aren\u2019t created is unnecessary? \n\nEarly on I read on the 1918 Flu epidemic and it convinced me how potentially dangerous Covid was and how that could be true of any new virus. And I also learned (I was also an icu nurse during my career) that masks are not that much of an inconvenience and can keep the wearer safe and protect other people from what I might carry. What I find most concerning is how so many of the arguments against masking don\u2019t take consideration of other people into the calculus of masking. \n\nI think it will be shown masks help. They aren\u2019t perfect. Particularly the correct, well fitting, mask. As we await the next pandemic I hope the best mask is identified AND widely distributed. Unlike now where N95 masks are considered the gold standard , but inferior masks are handed out where masks are required.",

It wasn't so bad although I had to quarantine for 7 days  as I was on a project involving a small crew.  I'm an older person and I was encouraged to get vaccination number five.  I don't know if wearing a mask or getting multiple vaccinations have helped, maybe I could have been a lot sicker, but I am now on the fence about whether the mask and the vaccinations actually worked.",

I came out of research to work on Covid, I still am, I've not come down with Covid and I've had many opportunities, though no a single one of those opportunities involve NOT wearing a mask. So, with the effects of Covid, the long-haul symptoms and deaths, l'd like to make a very childish statement and say, \"Something is better than nothing.\" You won't catch me without a mask.",
        "I will continue to mask when transmission rates are high and/or when a virus is particularly nasty. Even if masks can't block all viral particles, they will block some or most of the aerosols. If I'm going to get sick, I'll take the smaller, initial viral exposure, thank you.",
        "The facts are fairly simple: well fitted N95 and better masks offer significant protection to the wearer.  If everyone in a crowd were so masked, there would be significantly less transmission of disease than among a similar but unmasked crowd.  If people wear ineffective masks such as the cloth ones that the CDC said were OK, then transmission is much worse as people come in close contact thinking they are protected when they are not.",

I understand mandating masks in April 2020 without sufficient data due to the emergency situation, but then the government should have funded several large trials whose results should have been available by now.

The particles that make up the visible smoke from cigarette smoking freely passes through medical masks and these particles are larger than virus containing aerosols therefore using the chicken wire analogy, Covid virus would be the rice.",

Most Americans did not get the latest bivalent booster, and whatever earlier vaccines they had has worn off. Yet there are less serious Covid cases than ever before.  Why? Everyday exposure! So take off that mask once in awhile - otherwise you\u2019re only making things worse for yourself. Think of the Native American experience when the white men came.",
        "The Cochrane study did NOT address the question of whether masks work.  It only looked at whether telling Americans to mask made a big difference.

Perhaps the best conclusion of the Cochrane study is that American are too stupid and selfish to be saved.",

If you touch a surface that has a virus (any virus) on it and you then  touch your nose or mouth there is a high chance you will get infected.  If you were wearing a mask this would not happen.  Secondly if you have a virus infection and you touch your mouth or nose you will spread the virus to anything that you touch. If you are infected and wear a mask you are less likely to infect what you touch because you cannot touch your mouth or nose. Using hand sanitizer will also help stop the spread.

We knew that properly fitting N95 masks were highly effective at filtering viruses of that size. While controlled studies are required to get the final efficacy numbers, the default response until those studies were completed should have be an N95 mask mandate in all enclosed public spaces. It would also have been great had we had a government stockpile on hand, along with onshore capacity to manufacture them. I'm glad that hospitals got priority for the good masks, but our general preparedness was awful. I have a sneaking suspicion that it may be backsliding again.",

We could release preliminary results and base initial recommendations on them.

        "In 1918 when Spanish flu swept the world many people wore masks to try to stop its spread. Some local governments adopted mask mandates (including San Francisco where a man was shot enforcing the mandate). \n\nDuring the Spanish flu pandemic and after, doctors debated whether masks helped. The American Medical Association commissioned a final report, and in 1926 it found that masks did not work. (See Jordan, Edwin Oakes. Epidemic Influenza: A Survey. Chicago: American Medical Assn., 1927.)\n\nStudies of masks since then have reached the same conclusion. There is no evidence that masks work in stopping the spread of respiratory viruses. That masks do work is mechanistically plausible, but there is no scientific evidence that they do. \n\nAs this article points out, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. But when there is no science to support a public health measure, that should be made clear. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we were told the opposite. We're just following the science, the mandators said. That was false. \n\nPublic trust in science is too important to toy with. That trust has been weakened by those who preach that masks work (like this article and those of Zeynep Tufekci) without the science to back them up. First, the scientific evidence, not the mandate.",

They are reasonably comfortable especially the 3M silicon version.  I routinely wear them for hours at a time.  \nThey do not significantly restrict breathing and special P100 filters are available for high exertions activities.  I wore one during a echocardiogram stress test on a treadmill with my heart going at twice the normal rate with no problem much to the surprise of the staff. \nThese masks fit very well because of the cinching straps.  In fact they are hard to wear them incorrectly unlike other masks.

Jefferson states clearly \"Relatively low numbers of people followed the guidance about wearing masks.\" Jefferson's work is based on 78 \"Randomized Control Trials\" (RCT) since 2006. So how could he draw conclusions that masks work or don't work? The correct conclusion should have been: \"Investigators did not ensure their own protocols to protect workers from infectious aerosols were strictly followed.\"\nSecond secret, which is not a secret at all. Respirators that seal with the skin of the face filter out airborne bio-hazardous aerosols. COVID-19 and similar diseases like influenza that don't enter the respiratory tract can't infect people. That knowledge has been around for over 40 years....but that knowledge has been distorted by people like Jefferson/Henghan of the UK and Loeb of Canada who put prevention second, not safety first.\nThe author of this article, Dr Nuzzo, is correct in saying that respirators or even medical masks (which block, not filter) must be worn consistently to prevent/block entry into the respiratory tract.\nBut Dr Nuzzo is wrong to give any credence to the Jefferson Cochrane methodology. In fact even the editors of the Cochrane Library are distancing themselves from the Jefferson study.",

The malarky about masks not working was just a ridiculous ad hoc weapon to use in the argument and only a few complete fools believe it.

And, in fact, proper grade masks undoubtedly protect individual wearers from various viruses, not just COVID.\nHowever, the efficacy of masking breaks down quickly in the case of societal mandates. What may be effective on an individual basis does not  necessarily work when imposed on the broad population. \nAdvocates on either side can point to statistical studies which purport to support their views. \nFinally, there are those who would impose their viewpoint on everyone, under some theory that we are all required to protect the most vulnerable. Maybe, but there are limitations.  I don't think that duty encompasses the most remote of possibilities, Maybe I might have COVID and not know it, but the odds are very, very unlikely. Then, it is even more unlikely that maybe I might pass the COVID I don't know I have to a particularly vulnerable person who by chance I happen to come in contact with. I don't think I have a duty to nevertheless assume I am always a potential threat.\nThose who want to wear masks should do so. But please don't impose your judgment on the rest of us.",

Rather than trying to get the doubters of everything to wear masks, which is probably doomed to fail, instructing those who are willing and providing an ample supply of N95 masks would probably make a huge difference in any future pandemic, which is highly likely to occur.",

Vaccines can reduce the chance of hospitalization and masks may provide extra protection. \n\nHowever, for children below age of 18, as the CDC data has shown now, Covid is not serious disease (1500 deaths in that cohort in the last 2 years and 4 months, half of Flu deaths ). Forcing children to wear them when evidence shows it harms learning outcomes is uncalled for. Thankfully, except as small group of people, no one believes we should impose mask mandates on schools.

That included masking, which, for reasons I cannot understand, is always assumed to protect the MASKED person from disease, rather than protected everyone else from the masked person. The reason for masks in surgery is NOT to protect the doctors and nurses. I thought everyone knew that. Apparently this author, among others, hasn't even any idea what masks are FOR.

Sure, not all questions are urgent enough to devote resources to proper clinical study (does chicken soup actually work?), and sure any epidemiological evidence is better than none, but trying understand if/what masks do seemed so less important than e.g, finding a vaccine or antiviral.

A surprisingly small amount of clinical research meets the highest standards.  Often this is for good reason (e.g. a randomized trial is too risky for the control group OR the population studied is too small because the condition is too rare OR the population studied cannot be double-blinded, etc).

Would you allow a surgical team to work on you if they were not wearing masks?  If not, why?  The answer is obvious insn't it.  No one even questions the need to be careful in the presence of airborne pathogens when its their neck on the line.\n\nMore studies are not the answer.  More education is what is needed.

        "If your mask works and is worn properly then why are you worried about someone else without a mask?  Same with the vaccine - if it works like you have been told you are good.  Unfortunately the masks most people wore were pretty ineffective which is why at a population level study masks made little difference.  And in regard to the vaccine, many had a false sense of security - at least initially.  The vaccine's effectiveness waned considerably faster than the vaccine makers expected and the vaccines did not prevent transmission.  So IMO next time we hopefully learn some lessons and focus on protecting the vulnerable - those 75 and older, those with chronic health care issues and those who are overweight or who don't have access to good health care.  We don't know who or what the next pandemic will affect, so we need to be nimble at identifying the proper risk groups and do our best to protect them.

        "\"masks were a reasonable step because they had few harms\"\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, describes my biggest gripe with the conservative reaction to masking mandates. I mean, how could it possibly hurt? Yeah, they're hot. Yeah, they're uncomfortable. I've heard asthmatics claiming their medical condition was aggravated by the masks (an entirely reasonable complaint), but \"I feel weird because I can't see people's mouths move\" or \"I want to make a political statement\" seem like a poor reason to rebel against the mandate. \n\nNow let's assume that masks are, say 10% effective at blocking transmission from one person to another, that would mean that, without any other measures, the pace at which the disease propagated through a population would be slowed. And that's what we were trying to do. Without the vaccine (which was an unbelievable success story for modern science), slowing the spread of the virus through our population meant that hospitals were that much less likely to be overwhelmed, right? It's not like by masking we'd never be exposed to covid in our lifetime, but rather, when we were and needed to go to the ER because we couldn't breathe, there would be an open ventilator, and the physicians might not be as close to exhaustion. \n\nFinally, let's assume that masking was completely ineffective. Who did it hurt?",
        "The population is divided between those who are willing to wear masks and subscribe to other recommendations for avoidance of spread and those that won't. The benefit of wearing a mask in population studies will be obscured by the immense reservoir of virus harbored by those who instead of taking measures to reduce spread are doing the exact opposite.",

That is one reason the trump administration, in the White House alone, at one point had more Covid-19 infections than the entire country of mask-wearing Taiwan. It's also the reason why so many of the leading and supposedly \"conservative\" talk show hosts that told their listeners masks did nothing died from the disease.\n\nBut what do I know, I am just an engineer that has made a career - and, indeed, a life - based of science, facts, truth, logic, and perhaps even some common sense thrown in.",

I consider these two groups of shoppers to be more \"health aware\" and they likely followed other mitigating behaviors such as avoidance of crowds and hand washing. Separating these factors leads researchers to require randomized studies, as the authors correctly note, and which lead to the conclusions about the effectiveness of mask mandates.

Simply put, most people could see the logic of how a person coughing into a mask instead of into the open air (or their hand) is \"better\" when trying to limit the spread of a virus.  When the CDC and other government officials started getting cute and coy about the effectiveness of wearing a (basic) mask in preventing a person from GETTING the virus, they lost the messaging battle.

Hint - if people are walking around with a mask hung over their chin but not protecting their mouth and nose, then it's not masks that are failing in their function it is public health education and and implementation.\nOr, the data that the Cochrane analysis used was not reliable or relevant (garbage-in garrbage-out analysis).\nEither way, saying simpy that \"Masks don't work\" is just a bald falsehood.",
        "The notion that masks don't work for airborne spread viruses is patently absurd. There is abundant evidence that they do work. Health care workers have been required to wear them and other PPE for many years when entering hospital rooms of certain patients. Every patient care textbook clearly delineates the different types of PPE required for different situations and hospital rooms are marked accordingly. Citing the Cochrane study, which doesn't reach any conclusions, is irresponsible. Debating the issue is simply beating a dead horse. Those who don't like masks when be required to undergo all surgeries with surgeons not wearing masks.",
        "I still find it amazing when people cite mixed results on masking effectiveness in the US and Europe and some lab studies that are inconclusive.  Everyone seems to fully ignore the many countries in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore) that have much higher population densities than most Western countries, much more reliance on crowded public transportation, and a societal tendency to look out for the group and where most (90%+) consistently mask up.  Japan for example on top of that has an extremely elderly population.  \n\nAll of these countries had a death rate a fraction of that of most large Western countries.  The main commonality among those Asian countries is that everyone masked for the benefit of the general population, whereas in the US and many other Western countries, it was a political issue where you never had a large majority of the population (90%+) that would consistently mask.",
        "Not being in the trenches, I might have missed some recent developments, but I don't understand why, over 2 years since the start of the pandemic, we don't seem to have more clearcut lab data about mask effectiveness. Early on there seemed to be some experiments being run (I seem to recall hamsters behind cloth filters or some such thing) where some effort was being put into determining the basic question of whether a breathable barrier could actually, as opposed to simply theoretically, block or reduce the flow of virus particles and prevent infection. Why can't we say for sure at this time if that is true or not? Surely we can design and run controlled experiments and try to establish this once and for all?\n\nBecause if it is true, then the population level stuff really doesn't matter, at least not at the level of individual decision making (versus government mandates and policy). The advice for anyone seeking to reduce their chances of coming down with COVID or of spreading the virus to others would be absolutely straightforward: wear the mask around other people. Personally, I am convinced from anecdotal reporting that the vast majority of consistent mask wearing people who eventually contracted COVID probably did so through maskless interactions with close friends and family members. But obviously proving such a thing is pretty much impossible with all the factors involved, so let's just prove what we can prove on a limited basis.",
        "Any barrier that prevents droplets from flying at you or in the air around you will provide some protection as opposed to nothing at all. So, masks work. The question is to what degree and whether that degree is worth the effort of donning one on. In this case, the old adage is true, something is better than nothing.",
        "Could we turn this upside down for a moment?\n\nScience denial works. Mask denial works. Vaccine denial works. Lies work.\n\nIndeed they do. They dilute every kind of effective interaction that helps us help each other.\n\n[In caring for my mother at a nursing home, I was exposed to covid and used the most rudimentary of fabric mask, and it definitely helped me and the people around me. The slightest precaution to avoid spreading germs (consider how the common cold and flue disappeared) is effective. How stupid are we to keep fighting over self-righteous assertions that nobody is entitled to protect themselves but attacks are fine?]",
        "This article tries so hard to be neutral that it fuels both sides of the argument, no favor to either side. Can we not agree that, while perhaps not the \"optimum protectection\", masks are better than nothing?",
        "It only seems logical that if we don't have all the answers yet, the default during a pandemic with more lethality than influenza would be masking in public spaces until we do know. Trump, standing on the balcony of the White House and ripping his mask off like a petulant child is one of those reasons we have so much handwringing over this issue. Public Health officials should not have to keep apologizing for making the best recommendations they could in real time and adjusting them as needed.",
        "Masks are uncomfortable because your breath is pushed back onto your face, before finally escaping out to the surroundings through its edges.  That warm humid exhale fogs up your glasses and makes your face feel clammy and hot.  I had a mask with an outlet valve and airtight edges that was much more comfortable because your exhale exited out the valve, keeping your face cool and because the edges were airtight, keeping out germs much better than ordinary masks.  When inhaling, the valve closed and you drew air in through its N95 filter.  It was a superior mask and so I felt safe among unmasked people.  People will say, yeah but how about your breath escaping into the surroundings, and I'd say that ordinary masks do the same thing.  That's why I don't care if we have another mask mandate because I'll be wearing a superior mask for safety and for comfort.  I won't disclose the brand until I fill my stockpile of pandemic protection gear.",
        "maybe if the general populous was more like robots, and perfectly executed directions, we would all be perfectly 'safe'.  hmmm i guess I'm glad we are not perfect robots.  and any discussion of this should involve the issue of waste and all the garbage being produced, which as we can observe always rises up to cause more environmental hazards...",
        "A friend of mine has been very careful throughout the pandemic and has been masked in public, as have the vast majority of people in Japan. On Saturday 22 April she went to a yoga session for the first time without a mask. By the following Tuesday she had contracted Covid, and has had a fever since then. The first thing she said to me about this was that masks had until then protected her.\n\nMany people outside of Japan may think there's been a mask mandate here since most people wear masks in public. They'd be entirely mistaken: Japan law has never required masks, people have voluntarily worn them because there is a cultural care for others' welfare.",
        "The author makes some good points. And certainly no one would disagree that more studies would be useful.\n\nBut the best evidence of mask mitigation is based on contingencies that simply don\u2019t work as public policy.\n\nIf you have a M95 or M 96 mask, and if you are properly fitted, and if you are properly trained on how to put it on and how to remove it, and if it is used only once before replacement and if it is properly disposed as medical waste, it will, as in hospital settings significantly reduce infections rates.\n\nBut it should be obvious that what works for trained medical personnel will not work as a general policy for the public.\n\nThe across the board mask mandates were based on the \u201canything is better than nothing\u201d standard and rather than reduce infection, probably produced a false confidence that might have done more harm than good.\n\nWe also need to study the harmful effects of prolonged masking. Many workers were required to wear a mask for full eight hour shifts. This is never done in hospital settings without opportunities for periodic unmasking.\n\nAnd the reason is that there are serious downsides from that behavior. \n\nWe know a lot more about SARS-CoV2 now than we did in March, 2020 but you wouldn\u2019t know it from current policies that are still frozen in early Covid time.\n\nThat needs to change, and more open debate and review of the growing body of science is a good step in that direction.",
        "The Cochran Review was terribly written, mostly did not address covid and has been roundly criticized.  What we actually need, more than more study, is a cooperative public and correct use of masks as is true in Japan.",
        "Related question: People who refuse to wear masks: How would you feel going into surgery and seeing no one in the OR wearing a mask? would you be concerned? Medical personnel wear masks for a reason and my guess is that very few feel it is an incursion of their civil liberties or evidence of a dictatorial takeover.",
        "On masking, you know that respiratory diseases can  be spread  by close contact with others, it takes very little effort to put a mask on, an N95 mask  is cheap, I am 77 1/2 years old, covid is still around, logically a mask is another barrier that I can control to being affected  by bad stuff in the air. I wear a mask when I sand with my electric sander, or use oil based paint and stains. \n\n I buy home insurance every year and  its my good fortune that I never have to  collect on it. Its a lot more expensive than buying a mask  and I never have needed it, but I will be buying it again this year. \nI am not sure that you can ever humanly  design the kind of research that would \u201cprove conclusively\u201d  that wearing a mask protects  you from getting covid.  But anecdotally, from my friends who have had it, the one thing that stands out  over the past few years is going to church services is a likely place to get infected.",
        "Being older and having masked when first suggested, I do believe that good masks may have helped somewhat. But the initial masking advice, for example using a cloth mask, probably did not do much of anything and in retrospect was likely misguided. Medical masks have worked for medical professionals for a long time, but were not provided initially. Call it poor planning, or just more large government unpreparedness, the meat was not on the bone in the actions of many governments.  \n\nIn my view, the real problem was not related to the initial emergency reactions, but in the seemingly unrelenting pursuit of mandates well beyond the initial emergency. It does seem from today's perspective well beyond when necessary. Examples include school closures in many places for well too long, confusing and conflicting mask advice, travel restrictions enforced by some states, like NY, that violated the Constitution, and in general the use of emergency declarations for well more than was prudent.",
        "We know how big the virus is, how it is spread, and the filtering characteristics of KN95 and N95 masks when properly worn. In an environment where both the uninfected and the infected are wearing well fitting masks, especially high quality, N95 rated masks, it is scientifically obvious, based on the well-known physical characteristics of the virus and the masks, disease spread was reduced. The author of this commentary clearly outlined holes in that horribly conceived study questioning masking effectiveness one could fly a 747 through. The only question outstanding is to what degree the spread is reduced, is it twenty-five, fifty or seventy-five percent? No matter the exact percentage, masking likely saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of additional lives globally, and hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in additional disruption and treatment costs. \ufffc What we really need to study is how to build better masks to combat future disease spread that are more effective and comfortable. \ufffc Why every mask used during Covid was not at least of N95 level filtering quality is another question we really should be asking ourselves. \ufffc Yes, loud masking critics like commentator Bill Maher are correct, we may have went overboard with wearing masks outdoors in the wide open spaces. He is also likely to be very wrong about mask mandates in general and other precautions which were very necessary to save lives. Dead wrong.\ufffc",
        "There are a lot of variables in a general mask study, human behaviour and physical environment being vast categories of variables on their own.  \n\nI worked during covid with the public even before vaccines. I wore a mask each day. \nWe allowed only a few masked clients at a time into the large work area.  \nAs coworkers, we kept plenty of space between us. Everyone who could work at home did so, to keep the space sparsely populated. \n\nI did not get sick during that time- neither with covid nor flu. \n\nThe common paper masks are a crude filter.  They aren\u2019t a 100% guarantee, but keeping some snot and spit from flying around is a sensible idea to reduce respiratory illnesses. \n\nThe human element is that a lot of people hate wearing them- like refuse to do so.  They aren\u2019t comfortable and are socially awkward. \nI don\u2019t love the masks either but understand they are simply a health hygiene tool to be used in some settings at particular times.",
        "Thank you for this clear, thoughtful and sadly still timely article. Proper wearing of an N95 mask for the past three years when in the company of others has kept me from falling sick with Covid . I hate wearing this mask, but seeing friends die from Covid gives me the incentive to keep it securely on, over both mouth and nose. I've been the lone masked ranger in the market, on the plane, anyplace where people are together in close spaces. This should not be a political matter. It's science.",
        "As a Heath Care worker for over 50 years I know that masks worn correct;y and changed on  a regular basis work. But too many people were quick to stop wearing their masks as soon as they heard that COVID cases had gone down or believed the false information that masks do not work. I also realize that after more than 3 years most of us are just worn out and try to return to pre pandemic conditions. I urge folks to at least wear their mask in public places like libraries, supermarkets, museums, airports and to remember that handwashing and social  distancing also help to reduce disease transmission",
        "There must be some fight going on in the Times's editorial offices over the masking issue.  First, Brett Stephens published an op-ed piece thoughtlessly accepting entirely the Cochrane study, then the Times published another op-ed criticizing the Cochrane study (and not mentioning Stephens' earlier piece) and now this--typically, \"more studies need to be done.\"  Hardly true.  This article itself shows that masks reduce the possibility of inhaling the virus or transmitting it for individuals.",
        "\"Maybe people didn\u2019t wear masks properly...\" Reminds me of a medical authority being interviewed on a Sunday morning political show being asked if wearing a mask below the nose was effective. His reply, \"That's like fixing four of the five screen doors on your submarine\".",
        "Definately ONLY got sick from family members ( our own adult kids)....never anyone else because we ALWAYS wear/wore a mask when we were 'out'..the lack of T cells is obviously a detriment but obviously humans constant use of masks is far from perfect.",
        "We still don't know?  The fact its still a question puts in doubt 90% of what the \"experts\" or \"health organizations\" told us what to do during the pandemic!  Government isn't there to protect us, its first order of business is to protect their jobs....which ends up meaning never taking a risk and phrasing recomendations in such a way that you can later use the \"misinterpreted\" defense.",
        "So tiresome.  Again, the \"we just don't know\" mantra.",
        "It\u2019s time for a rational POV that masking more likely than not will work at a laboratory level assuming perfect testing conditions, perfect compliance, perfectly comparable immunities, etc.  But, at the population level, with all its randomness and uncontrollable variables, it probably made no difference, and couldn\u2019t.  If our leadership would have said this, and accepted a more likely than not position, made strong recommendations rather than mandates, we would be a happier community acting rationally for the good of the group",
        "It was a novel virus. It was not clear how it spread. People were dying, although age seemed to be a major factor. \nIt was not irrational to try to slow the spread because hospitals were being overwhelmed in the places where the spread was most intense. Even DeSantis and Trump briefly adopted closings to try to fight the virus. \nThe situation was worsened because the supply of high quality masks was insufficient. The idea that homemade cloth masks would stop the virus was always questionable. \nWhen politicians decided that confusing people would help their \"numbers\" rationality was doomed. They did not want to invest in well-designed studies. Some of them did not want to know how and where the virus was spreading. \nSome cultures are more accepting of wearing masks in public. The culture in the US seemed to find it \"wussy\" to put on a mask and only the desire to protect oneself could effectively motivate the reluctant. Of course, if significant numbers refused to mask, masks would not protect. \nMaybe we need to think about how to enhance support for public health. If we don't, I doubt that studies, no matter how well-designed, will work.",
        "Here's a thought: Why not ask the thousands of doctors and nurses over the years who have worn masks out of necessity either to protect a patient or to be protected themselves from a patient with a communicable disease?  I am a retired hospital RN, and I can not say enough how important masking is.  Furthermore, I am somewhat angered that this debate is still going on.  Masks work, period.  But they must be applied correctly, changed regularly, and be made to both prevent and protect one from the spread of infection.  And I will say another thing: politics has absolutely no right to have the audacity to second guess, spin, or even lie about what time-tested medical science has taught us.  Finally, during this day and age, we should never, never have lost over a million Americans from Covid.  Don't blame science. please.  Instead look to the political leaders and Americans who listened to the propaganda concerning this 100 year pandemic.",
        "And of course masks will be twice as effective if both parties in an interaction are wearing them properly!",
        "Considering how conflicting the data is and the fact that Covid spread was not terribly affected by different state policies, which were either very strict, or very lax,\ufffc any reasonable scientist would say it is far from clear, and therefore the government ought to tread very very lightly.",
        "Great article. As someone who made a living from using data to solve problems, I am very happy to see someone point out that most basic difference in results, \"...absence of evidence of effectiveness is not the same as having evidence of ineffectiveness.\"\n\nWhen a laboratory test clearly shows one thing, and those results aren't reflected in the outside world, the question to be asked is \"what is different in the outside world\" not \"is the laboratory data invalid?\".\n\nOf course for those who just want an excuse to make masks a culture war, rather than use information to save lives, this is not important. But thank you for the article."
