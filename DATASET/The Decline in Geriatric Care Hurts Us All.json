        "Given the Gerontocracy's stranglehold on government you would think they could at least get this right.",
        "I worked at an Area Agency on Aging for over twenty years.   I was astonished to learn that the major university in the city where I worked did not have one course in gerontology, within their school of medicine.  This was in the 1990s.  Given the change in demographics regarding the growing number of older adults,  I found that astonishing.  \n\nWe worked long and hard to convince them it was important.  And they did finally add one course.  I would be curious to know if things have changed much. \n\nAll I can recommend is that, if you are able,  when you visit your doctor be prepared with your concerns and advocate for yourself. Write the most important points down to bring in wit you.  If you can't or if you feel your concerns are not being addressed, get a patient advocate.   Many places like Kaiser must provide them,  but it is often a well kept secret.",
        "It doesn\u2019t all have to be about specialists. Board-certified Family practice physicians have the training to care for aged patients. They can also add a fellowship in geriatrics if they desire. Yes, in the 80\u2019s it was hoped that PAs and NPs would do primary care as partners to FPs, with the physician as mentor.  However, much better salaries are there for the taking in anesthesia, orthopedics, etc,  I don\u2019t blame them for going to those specialties. Also, much more excitement. It\u2019s unfortunate but true that it\u2019s very, very difficult to pay off education loans unless able to earn more money. And I don\u2019t know where journalists get these \u201caverage\u201d salaries-you cannot mix surgeon salaries with family practice, pediatrician, and internist salaries.",
        "We've spent all this time trying to figure out how to make the most privileged among us live longer, and never once did we stop to ask whether anyone could or would come when they tap the \"Nurse\" button. \n\nFor once, I see a silver lining in having a lower-than-average life expectancy.",
        "The New York Times article \"The Decline in Geriatric Care Hurts Us All\" highlights the erosion of specialized geriatric care, which is essential as the aging population grows. A key concern often overlooked is the decline of bedside manner in healthcare. Many elderly patients are treated by physicians lacking expertise in their unique needs, leading to a loss of empathy and communication. The absence of bedside manner\u2014marked by compassion, attentiveness, and effective communication\u2014undermines trust and patient well-being, particularly in geriatric care. Without the emotional support of a provider who listens, older patients often feel isolated and misunderstood. To improve care, we must not only restore geriatric specialization but also emphasize compassionate, person-centered care, which can significantly enhance both outcomes and quality of life.",
        "All doctors DO get training on geriatrics in medical school, and anybody who does family medicine or internal medicine residency gets training in geriatrics. Geriatrics is set up as a fellowship after one of these other residencies (similar to cardiology, gastroenterology, palliative care, etc). Many medical schools do not require a dedicated clinical rotation in geriatrics, though you would still be expected to cover it by seeing elderly patients in clinic and hospital settings in the context of internal and family medicine rotations. Medical licensing exams for doctors cover geriatrics. The learning about the physiology is there. This is clearly still an issue, but this is a factual error with this reporting",
        "The recent issue of the AARP bulletin headlines the \"doc shortage\" ... for all practical purposes, it's across the board but especially dire for seniors.  \n\nOne would assume that the politicians know that the \"old folks\" vote... before much longer, they will become one of the largest voting groups in the country...  about 13,000 of us turn 65 every day and the over 75 group remains very active.  \n\nGuess who they will vote for....?",
        "My 2 grandmothers and my great aunt died more than 30 years ago, at advanced ages. All three had excellent geriatricians who helped them lead long and productive lives. Today I have not been able to find any geriatricians even though I am geriatric and live among many others.",
        "When my board-certified internist who had been my PCP for 20 years retired just before the pandemic, I found a geriatrician whom I really liked. Because this was the height of the pandemic, my first appointment was a virtual one over Zoom. We talked for over half an hour. After a couple years, she left to join a concierge practice. The geriatrician who was hired to be her successor lasted about a year before leaving for another state. The geriatrician who was hired to replace HER was \u201cnot accepting new patients\u201d, although I was not a \u201cnew patient\u201d but a legacy patient of the departed geriatrician. American corporate medicine plays a big part in this merry-go-round for patients.",
        "Dr Tim Farrell , the doctor interviewed in the article, has not been accepting new patients for a while. Also no other doctors in his geriatric clinic are accepting new patients. I am willing to pay speaker fees to him to go visit medical schools and recruit some new gerontologists.\nHe was always on my list of good doctors, I have referred my older friends to him. I am so disappointed he is also retiring just when I need him.",
        "We appreciate this article's thoughtful analysis and encourage everyone to use the 4Ms to ensure we all get high-quality, age-friendly health care as we get older, with or without a geriatrician. Talk with your healthcare team about what matters to you, your medications, your mentation (memory & mood), and your mobility at every visit. And encourage all your hospitals, practices, nursing homes, and other healthcare organizations to join the Age-Friendly Health Systems movement!",

        "\ud83e\udd14 I took care of my parents.  The Geriatric doctor always seemed bored or just became accepted of what ailed my Mom because there was no fix.  Every Medication had side effects. Every month another problem.  It was so sad and stressful.  I was going crazy trying to help my Mom, but to no avail.  Many Dr\u2019s don\u2019t want to treat elderly because there is no cure. It\u2019s defeating.",
        "I don't see \"allowing the patient to take the lead\" as ever going to happen, for patients of *any* age. For one thing, only sheep-like compliance works in today's transactional health care (hah!) system, where people are little more than units of profit. And older people are further reduced to retail components by gross infantilization. I'm over 70, my coronary artery calcium scan score (which I sought and paid for myself) is zero thanks to 50 years of excellent diet, exercise, and stress-management. Yet ever since I turned 50, almost everyone I've encountered in any medical or dental setting has treated me as stupid and expected me to be meek. I am neither. And I'm pretty sure the amount of time I spend studying PubMed, and sorting pharma-sponsored research from unbiased research, is much more than they put in. So I'll go to the ER if I get hit by a car. But I simply don't go in for the check-ups and such they say are necessary. I am pretty sure I know more about health than they do: they only make money on pathology.",
        "The primary problem in the US is that you do not have a health care system but a health care business with, as its main goal, making a profit, not caring about health really at all. In fact, there is little incentive to change this as ill health (repeat visits, additional prescriptions) are better money makers than good health can ever be. \n\nAdditionally, preventive health care is undervalued and under reimbursed. Many problems faced by an older population might not have developed as badly in the first place if adults had the opportunity to consult over the years with doctors who could have guided them into healthier lifestyles. \n\nAnd I agree with you that a huge stumbling block to adequate geriatric care is an attitude of pretending that death is not inevitable for all of us. Somehow, we have traded quality for quantity as if these are the same thing.",
        "As a geriatrician, I am forever stunned at the lack of understanding needed to care for the older old. Our society does not value evaluation and management of patients. Geriatric fellowships are feeling only at 40%. Young doctors would rather be cardiologists and dermatologists.\n\nThe cost of mistakes is not even tallied. But I can tell you my patients don\u2019t go to the hospital. Being on call all the time I take care of problems before they get big. I don\u2019t just send them to the ER. \n\nKnowing what medication\u2018s cause problems is also huge. And not widespread either.  Most agitation in  dementia can be cared for at home and relieved by getting rid of the wrong medicines, treating pain and getting elders engaged with support.  Sadly, I often hear that if an elder with dementia has agitation they\u2019re often sedated and put on hospice.  \n\nWe should do better.\n\nDrLizGeriatrics.com",
        "Let's start with loan forgiveness for medical students who undertake these lowely paid specialties and work in these areas  for a certain period of time. This would free many to enter these specialties without having to worry about their financial circumstances and to provide the healthcare that we desperately need.",
        "Thank you for this article which adds to the discussion of our very broken heath care system in this country. I am 76 years old in failing health, what I often hear or see are efforts to keep extending life often at huge financial and emotional costs. For many of us elderly people we are more concerned with a degree of relative comfort such as effective pain management or mobility issues. Our planet is already over populated so do we really need to see people living into their late 90's or into their 100's. A subject we avoid and deny in this country is learning to live with the inevitability of death, how to accept our own fate.",
        "We do not need more geriatricians - or even internists. What we need are more physicians who are trained to understand the role nutrition plays in disease and are willing to educate patients on how a plant-based diet may be utilized to treat and reverse disease processes without kidney-killing pills. \n\nOtherwise, our healthcare system might become sustainable if we cut out the physician and let pharmaceutical reps interact directly with patients. Why not? Big Pharma TV commercials already sell us on and tell us what we need.",
        "Yes, there is a desperate need for doctors who specialize in treating older people, and there are reasons why some few medical students and doctors choose to specialize in geriatrics, while many more do not.\n\nOver the 30 years where I taught gerontology, the medical school had two excellent geriatricians, who had superb reputations in the city and the university for educating and working with older patients and their families. Both were fine physicians and individuals with strong character, who were widely liked by nearly everyone.\n\nBoth worked very hard to recruit medical students into geriatrics but had scant success. Why?\na. Geriatric doctors are not paid or reimbursed well; it is low status within the profession. \n\nBut, maybe this not such a bad thing. Who wants a physician when they are older or treating their parents, who is in it for the money, status, and prestige, and may be one of those \"time-is-money\" docs?\n\nb. It takes a special kind of human person to do well in geriatrics, who must have not only lots of specialized information related to aging, but also, an enjoyment of working with older patients and their families.\n\nOne study found that the best people in medicine to work with older people are those who had a wonderful relationship with an older person, often when growing up. I found this to be absolutely true. \n\nBasically, the entire medicine and health care field is a mess in this country. It is not a money-making business, it is a service to humans.",
        "I\u2019m in the medical space. Not many people mention this but this is real. We have encountered many patients who simply don\u2019t appreciate or respect medical professionals. No one has any illusion about healthcare is a thankless job but that is saddening. Does any sane person need that? No. I would not push my kids into medical field.",
        "Three different elderly people in my family had terrible reactions to commonly prescribed medications (statins, antidepressants, cardiac drugs) that turned them into either zombies or anxiety-ridden messes who couldn't sleep, were confused, etc. \n\nIn every case, their middle-aged daughters were the ones who realized this, interfered, and got them to stop or cut way back on the meds, which basically solved or greatly ameliorated the problem overnight. \n\nTheir doctors did nothing, though they at least agreed to changing/stopping the medications once the daughters brought it up. \n\nIn one case, this prevented a likely move to an assisted living facility where costs began at $5000/month. When the meds stopped, the problem was reduced so much that assisted living was no longer needed. \n\nFolks, if your elderly parent is having problems, the FIRST thing you should do is see how many of their medications you can stop or reduce. In my experience most physicians just prescribe even more drugs when elderly patients come to them with a problem.",
        "There is such a huge difference in the way geriatricians approach their patients, and it's something all doctors could learn from.  Geriatricians see the whole patient -- not just a particular organ or system they specialize in.  They get the concept of quality of life rather than quantity.  Specialist doctors often have a kind of tunnel vision, that just focuses on their organ or system.  Even most primary care doctors aren't very good at understanding the tradeoffs and burdens of the treatments they prescribe, and seeing the context of the patient's lifestyle and goals.  Some of that is due to our for-profit wealth care system that doesn't allow them enough time to get to know the patient, and that judges them on inflexible metrics that don't take the patient's preferences into account.  Some of it is training to focus on fixing an immediate problem rather than focusing on overall quality of life.",
        "I often wonder why all the Great Minds and Pundits in our society did not figure out long ago that the aging of the Boomers would put a tremendous strain on our medical system. This is yet another crisis of our own making.",
        "This is a very important topic.  I do need to point out that many Family Physicians are competent in this area and do an excellent job of taking care of patient 65+. Seeing a NP or PA is not inferior to seeing an MD!  They have likelt studied geriatrics in school and are excellent clinicians. The MD is always available for consultation when if needed.  \n\nRetired PT here.  Physical Therapists have a large percentage of patients who are 65+, (40-50% range).  We have a professional Geriatrics specialty we can obtain.  Geriatrics coursework is typical in PT schools and is tested on the board exam for licensing. \n\nWhile we may not have enough geriatricians, we can utilize what is available currently while encouraging and promoting this specialty to medical students. Pay can be an issue. \n\nMedicare payment for all services must increase to allow us to take care of this age group.  Time spent on evaluation and care coordination should be recognized as part of what patients need. Medicare rates inform all health care insurance companies so increasing rates for Medicare benefits us all.",
        "I am 77 and have watched this situation worsening as I age. When I look at Medicare reimbursement rates, I understand why: the rates are insulting for primary care and gerontology doctors who spent years training, and the rates hurt seniors who have complex health issues and need doctors who can spend more time with them. We old people are not the most appealing or attractive demographic, and we may be dying at a faster rate than in our youth, but with the right kind of healthcare, we may remain independent and relatively well for longer. That is all we really want, to be able to contribute to and enjoy the life we have left. We need the doctors who can help us do that and let us go painfree and in peace when the time comes.",
        "As a geriatric NP, I appreciate the focus on this topic. I was hopeful when Kamala announced she would be working on getting caregivers paid for by Medicare. Do I think it would have been fixed by her? Not necessarily but the attention needs to be placed on this topic. Assisted Living facilities are a huge financial burden. Keeping aging, less functional parents at home is a significant time and energy burden, especially if you're working full time. \n\nFrom a career perspective, I have immense personal satisfaction from what I do. I advanced my education specifically to go into this field. You can imagine how it feels when every year Medicare announces their reimbursement rates - and they've gone down AGAIN. I feel betrayed that \"the system\" doesn't financially reward those of us doing heart wrenching, difficult, and noble work.",

        "Decline?\nSurely you jest.\nThere is no real, successful, humane geriatric care.\nIt's become a bottom line, for profit driven industry.\nAnd yes, another failure of our vaunted capitalism.\n\nIn today's America aging is a punishment of sorts for the \ngreat majority of its citizens.\nThe wealthy Americans are doing just fine as they can afford the help and support necessary for the unavoidable ever increasing incapacity that comes with aging.\nBut for Joe Main Street it can be a horrible existence before a \nthankful death.\nWe can ? and must do better !",
        "Wow.\nThat would be nice. \nWhere are elders getting this level of care? \nWhere are we able to talk about more than one malady at an appointment? Where can I get a doctor who will actually see me on consecutive visits, as opposed to the \"you'll see whoever still works here this week\" situation I now face?\n\nMy large but locally owned clinics were bought out by UnitedHealthcare. Yep. An insurance company now owns my clinic and insurance executives are now my doctor's bosses. I have no idea who my PCP is. Before I can meet them, they leave. Or, maybe they don't leave, but still I get shuffled to someone else. The notion of \"wholistic medicine\" used to be the goal of all clinics. Now, that is like a cruel joke. It could not be further from our actual experience.\n\nCapitalism has broken health care in the United States. \n\nJust like it broke farming and ranching (buying up family farms as fast as they can, then ruining them). Like it broke retail (tear down Mom and Pop's store to put up yet another Dollar Store! Pharmacies: Walgreens bought out our local, employee owned chain of Bi-Mart Pharmacies, AND THEN CLOSED THEM - they only wanted to eliminate the competition! That used to be illegal, before Citizen's United allowed the super-rich to purchase themselves some politicians along with their Yachts!\n\nCapitalism, under a democracy, is NOT supposed to be like this!",

        "While increasing capitation  payments to Medicare Advantage plans annually, despite  their well exposed ripping off the system in numerous ways, the Medicare fee schedule for doctors has decreased payments for five consecutive years even during a period of roaring inflation.\nConsequently, doctors who can are minimizing or eliminating their care of patients insured by Medicare. The group least able to cut their ties to Medicare are geriatricians. Clearly, speaking through its actions, our government has made clear that it doesn\u2019t value the contribution to care of that specialty. If one were graduating medical school with substantial debt, or even without that burden, would it make sense to opt for a low paid specialty which is almost entirely joined at the hip to Medicare insured patients.

        "The entire healthcare system needs an overhaul. I am an advocate for my 90-year-old mother who does have a geriatrician as her primary healthcare provider. The problem is that unless it's urgent, he rarely talks to her other providers or even bothers to find out who else she's seeing, for what, and the progress she's making. It's too fragmented. Specialists tend to have tunnel vision. Most of them have physicians' assistants and nurse-practitioners. And you still have to wait at least six weeks to see someone.",
        "AARP should walk the Hall of Shame by its endorsement of the UnitedHealthcare Advantage plan without an explanation of the many disadvantages, including the length it will go to avoid paying a bill.\n\nThat said, I give a shout out to those doctors, who add Critical Care to their specialities, since many surgeons are cavalier about precautions necessary when operating on a superficially vibrant elderly person, when not treating them as Soylent Green inside for-profit hospitals. Doctors trained in Cuba are accustomed to limited resources, so particularly dismiss necessary treatment for the borderline elderly (just under 65) who are under-insured or uninsured. \n\nI have witnessed this as an advocate for the almost elderly taken to for-profit hospitals like Kendall-Regional (recently shut to metamorphose as something under a new banner) and Hialeah. In the one hospital, an uninsured 64 year old suffered a bed where his feet dangled over the edge, because he was too tall for it and told by the doctor to prepare to die because he didn't have a bed for him in intensive care; and in Hialeah, the (homeless) gentleman was transferred to the hospice wing, because the doctor declared his ear cancer inoperable. I chased out the minister who claimed I was in denial, and with a signed limited power of attorney I was able to transfer him to Jackson where the doctor there successfully operated on the ear, keeping him alive another decade.",
        "Forget about it, Ms. Paul. America's healthcare system is like the gun violence we have lived with and died from for decades. Nothing will change for the better for our elders because profit is the goal and guiding principle and the profiteers aka oligarchs own our government.\n\nAmericans keep voting for the politicians who will always do the bidding of the oligarchs because the oligarchs can easily scare us about \"government healthcare.\" So we all have to suffer until voters stop being scared. \n\nI am not scared at all of my original (not Advantage) government-run Medicare. It has been problem-free for over ten years and covered every medical service I and my husband have needed without prior authorization or claim denials by some insurance company. If a doctor says I need it, Medicare has paid for most of it. \n\nI just wish other Americans would realize we could design a more efficient, simpler to use, and less expensive healthcare system if treating illness and maintaining health, at every age, were the goals instead of profits.",
        "The basic reason for so little motivation to increase the number os geriatric specialists and general practitioners is that so many students elect to be trained in specialties that perform procedures that result in  a major reimbursement to the health system and physicians which, in part mitigates the stress resulting from the huge debts incurred by attending medical school. It is time that students who could be committed to careers of non-procedure driven primary care specialties should have full scholarships,  and that their mean incomes should increase compared to what it is today..",
        "Our family is dealing with the ramifications of this right now.

Every single person I talk to who has parents who are deteriorating cognitively, all expressed tremendous frustration and complete disillusionment in the American healthcare system. And these are not people looking for extras, just good solid care. Things like accurate diagnoses, proper explanations, no six month backlogs for important test, etc. It\u2019s a total mess. We wish we had an actual geriatrician and someone who simply understood and cared.",
        "In teaching medical students and residents, one point I always emphasize is to check the medication list each time you see the patient to see what can be discontinued. This is especially true in older patients.  It is weel known that drugs are metabolized more slowly in the elderly, so dosing down is often appropriate. Patient seeing multiple doctors often have one medication piled on top of another, but no one looks to see what can be stopped.  Many people diagnosed with dementia just need to have  something stopped and not always the drugs you would think of.  I recall a case of a patient who was diagnosed with dementia and a stroke who recovered completely when his digoxin was discontinued.  There should definitely be more training in geriatrics in medical school.  Payment for these services also needs to be al lot better.",

        "For 30 years or so I have been blessed to have the internist of a patient's dreams: a physician savvy, knowledgeable, thorough, compassionate and an ally. Now I am geriatric -- and she retired.   \n\nA click moment: simply replacing a primary care physician is a challenge, even if you have good coverage. In advance of this change, about 6 months ago -I made an appointment with a new doctor -for a routine wellness visit - a first date of sorts -and the first date available was in April 2025.\n\nThere is definitely a problem in finding geriatricians per se - and also just generalists familiar enough with aging issues along with everything else.  \n\nThis is partly about money - payments for \"routine\" care need to be made competitive. Insurers' control over what merits higher compensation. Dr's need more time with patients. \n\n It is also about some issues which could be resolved with some political pressure and action: Limited medical school spaces despite expanding demand - which in the past at least was related to AMA obstinacy about expansion of medical education; lack of a funding stream to allow young physicians to go into practice without a huge load burden. \n\nThen there are the issues in practice itself: Insurers control, when they have an interest in denying approvals; burdensome recording systems; treating Drs. PA's and NPs staff as if they were fast food workers churning out burgers. No staff should have to take more time getting approvals than they spend focused on patients",
        "You hit our current crisis in having enough geriatricians on its head, the necessary dedication, pause and patience to spend more time with patients, not allowed by the \"corporatized health care\" delivered today in these United States...to our collective loss. As a retired physician, now a patient (83 yo), I can attest to the huge change...for the worse, as 'we' stopped being independent, and able to spend as much time as needed to get to know a patient, and the reciprocal trust required for his/her best care possible. The current U.S. Healthcare System is the most expensive in the world, in part because we don't spend enough resources in preventing disease, so much cheaper than having to treat an established disease (cardiopulmonary, diabetes, cancer, inmunologic issues, etc); and further, my shying away from seeing a specialist, by being told the visit shall take a max of 10 minutes or so. It sure sounds like that Big Business, the Corporate World, has bought physicians on the cheap, now their employees, for the profit motive...and where the patient has become just an afterthought...needed to justify the bill (if even affordable, that is!). Can't we see that without good health, the joy of life becomes miserable? Why risk it?  If Congress were ever willing to work for the people, and legislate towards a Universal Healthcare System, this nation may recover some credibility, that it cares for a solidarian answer to this crisis!  Do we care, and have the will to change?",
        "Why should our \"wealth care\" system spend more on the elderly? If they're not going to work, they aren't making a profit for the owners of the corporations.

Many times flailing about not knowing how/when/where to get the urgent care he needs. The system is indeed broken, barely on life support, and the bean counters don\u2019t give a damn.\n\nOur local clinic, 20 minutes away, was recently closed, and now we must go 35 minutes to another city to see our PCPs. They\u2019ve stopped allowing direct phone calls to the nurses in the clinic, outsourced Member Services to the Philippines, and cut back Urgent Care from 24/7 (35 min. away) to 13 hours.\nIt takes about two hours to travel to our specialists because we must take a ferry. \n\nGeriatric specialists in an HMO?

We're all going to die, and we're on the road to that every day. This isn't depressing. It should encourage people to take advantage of the present. I have arthritis. I'll have arthritis until the day I die. I've stopped even talking about it with my doctor. He can't fix it. I accept it. I take a Tylenol and get on with things. Medicine has limits.

        "No one is going to mandate more of a specific specialty, as there is no taste in the US to restrict residency opportunities.  The use of billing as a metric to determine salary is becoming a problem, because recent cutbacks in reimbursement and increases in overhead are to a point where no physician's salary can be maintained at current levels -- and we now have pressure on HHS through RFK Jr to cut even more.  In a corporatized world, most physicians depend on hospital (part A) reimbursement to partially supplement their salaries.  This in part makes up for the lack of reimbursement from Medicaid patients -- note that 2/3 of the money in Medicaid goes to the elderly.\n\nSince a huge percentage of senior patients go to more than one physician, a key is to integrate those visits into better networked care.  When I was working, my first medical question was a global \"how are you\", and if something was wrong, I would address it.  Specialists don't need to wear blinders regarding management of common medical problems, and if they truly don't know what to do about something significant, they can communicate through the medical record to the right doc.  \n\nHere's something else we need:  State medical boards need to allow retired docs to advise people on care, interpret records, intervene for patients.  Now, to do this, you need a license if done \"officially\", because it is \"practice of medicine\".   We should encourage retired docs to help the public.",
        "I am a 67 yo retired internist. I did a geriatric rotation in medical school. I loved it. This could have been written 35 years ago. Every old school internist practiced geriatrics. No one is going to leave practice to do a fellowship. Sadly, they ended the opportunity to get fellowship training by \u201c grandfathering in\u201d- getting certification by clinical experience and passing a board exam. That was unfortunate in my opinion. I loved my practice but it is hard to sell twice the work for half the pay with little status or respect from your employer. Don\u2019t blame insurance companies. They pay much better than traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans are especially good for primary care because they reimburse for preventative care. The solution remains to hold health systems accountable by moving from fee for service care to value based care. Maybe do an article on that.",
        "Primary care has been drastically underfunded for at least 30 years by all insurers, led by Medicare. It's a feature, not a bug. So we really don't have a \"crisis\" in primary care; we have the predicted outcome of the public policy of the past four decades, which I and many others argue underpins why our health care \"system\" has been failing almost as long as we can remember.\n\nCaring for the elderly is well within the purview of primary care physicians, if they had the time to spend with the patient. Everything is slower and longer with older grandparents, from taking a history to getting someone even partially undressed for an exam. Hence the penury associated with practicing exclusively with the elderly is even worse than for the generalist PCP. You have a really hard time earning a living as a gerontologist. \n\nFinally, the information we acquire in medical school rapidly ages. New information needs constantly to be acquired, added to a strong scientific base. Ozempic and GLP-1 agonists weren't taught in medical school when I went, because they didn't exist.

        "The fact of life is that as people age degenerative conditions present, initially with few symptoms and that progress to the point that they interfere with routine activities in some. The doctors that generally are seen due to degenerative conditions include orthopedists, neurologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists. endocrinologists and cardiologists. Degenerative conditions share the principal characteristics that while manageable they are not curable. The management of these conditions include medications that need frequent supervision, surgery  and physical therapy.  The complexity of these conditions is highlighted by the fact that in most individuals there are several degenerative conditions that can interact thus necessitating a high frequency of patient -physician interaction with multiple specialists. As the American population ages degenerative conditions will become more evident and no , although risk factors are frequently spoken of the reality is that the best way to approach degenerative disorders is to reduce the economic barriers to physician care and to lower the cost of medications. Successive attempts at structuring the economics of medicine has resulted disincentives to going into medicine thanks to dropping reimbursement rates, the cost of  medical education and perverse incentives that favor expensive interventions rather than poorly reimbursed physician management. The unavoidable fact is the the government must act and yes it will cost money.",

Admittedly, their \"published rates\" may be exorbitant, but Medicare's reimbursement rates are a joke. The lack of geriatric  doctors is yet another symptom of the ill-health of our healthcare system. It makes you realize that we all are on our own when it comes to our personal health, i.e., eat healthily, exercise, don't drink, etc. But that only delays the inevitable \u2014 which hopefully will end in our sleep.",

If you are not someone who has less than a 6 month prognosis and are eligible for hospice care - reimbursement is higher for procedures - the stuff that matters - time social histories - exhaustive mediation review - collaboration with family - do not provide revenue and hence are sidelined for things such as expensive medications with side effects and unnecessary procedures.

When providing the results, the doctor spoke to me and my husband about his mother, who was sitting in front of him, in the third person.

The level of disrespect for elderly people, even among Geriatricians is astonishing",
        "I practiced general internal medicine in a large, multi-specialty clinic for 25 years.  At least half my practice consisted of patients over 65.  The majority had complex, multi-system medical issues, and many also had limitations in hearing, mobility and/or cognition.  As pointed out, it takes a lot more time to take a history, examine and counsel these patients.  In addition to the management of medical issues, there are also discussions about safety, maintaining functionality and end of life issues that need to be addressed.  Given that, it is obvious that these patients do not fit the current medical model of the 15 minute visit, but that is what is expected.  It takes more time and more staff to take care of the geriatric patient, and frankly, any patient if you are doing it right.  Unfortunately, with low reimbursements and increasing overhead, primary care medicine has become a volume business.  There is no incentive to care for the medically complex patient.  I loved caring for my patients, but I retired when I realized that I would either have to change the way I practiced or take a 30% pay cut to continue to provide the type of care my patients deserved.  The reimbursement model for medicine will have to change if we want to see more physicians choosing a career in primary care, and especially geriatrics.",

A similarly large number of medical students are contemplating careers in research or other fields so that they can avoid patient care.  Burnout and life quality were the key factors, and a shortage of doctors, especially in primary care, fuels that viscious cycle.  Apparently, a prominent study in the 1980s concluded that America was producing too many doctors.  That caused med schools to reduce or freeze the number of graduates they produced rather than increasing them to match America's steady population growth.  We are still paying for that policy mistake today.\n\nFurther cutbacks to Medicare and Medicaid, combined with proposed deportation policies that will decimate the numbers of CNAs caring for disabled seniors, will be policy decisions that will dwarf the aforementioned med school enrollment mistakes.",

The rotation was wonderful: I had meaningful connections, I got to hear the wisdom and stories of the elderly, and I got to do home visits like how medicine used to be practiced.\n\nHowever, when I had to choose a specialty I did not choose a path to go to geriatrics and other potentially fulfilling specialties because I had practical concerns for my own life.  I have >$200,000 in student loan debt from medical school (that is with no debt from my undergraduate state school, and a partial scholarship in medical school).  My residency/fellowship training gave me a livable income at 65k a year, but not nearly enough to make a debt in my student loan debt.  A lot of interest accrued over 6 years at a 6-7% interest rate.  And I didn\u2019t have 6 years of my prime earning years at my full potential, and could not work towards other life goals like buying a house or saving optimally for retirement.. \n\nSo when the time came to pick a specialty, my colleagues and myself chose paths that would still be as fulfilling but also paid us higher incomes so we could address the above concerns.\n\nI am not so naive to say that we aren\u2019t still high income earners regardless when comparing a $250k salary to a $400k salary.  But we work hard and spent many nights and weekends away from friends and family.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to want to build a high income while working as a doctor, which is absolutely influencing specialty choice.",

But, of course, the other condition got worse, so Mom would go to the other doctor, who'd recommend cutting the first doctor's drugs and upping his.

Since I am part of a troublesome generation that refuses to go gladly into that good night, I\u2019ve been thinking for some time that geriatrics is a growth industry. With so many older doctors - who actually understand the effects of aging - retiring, young PCPs will find themselves with a larger roster of older patients. The PCPs - and medicine in general - will have to up their \u201cgeriatric game\u201d in order to serve them. And, as in every profession, all doctors are NOT created equal: so, if you can\u2019t find a good geriatrician, find a curious and talented PCP who listens to, asks questions, and hears what her patients, not just current protocols, have to say.

Maybe when someone starts a fellowship they have a job contract ready that actually pays well, provides adequate time per patient for care, etc. Dream on under our fee for service system. The reality is our society under values the old and the young when it comes to medical care. Geriatricians and pediatricians general are the lowest paid. Part of me can understand why we pay less for the old in a capitalist system, as the old generally are not net contributors, although many could be if we imagined society differently.

        "I spent 30 years as a geriatrician. It's a wonderful field. I had both a practice and I taught residents.

What mattered was whether one truly loved this population. For me that was the key. I put great love into the care of my patients. That's what made it fun and interesting. My patients were fascinating, usually wise and for the most part funny. \nI think one thing that would bring more doctors to the field would be to get younger people more exposure to elderly persons.  Getting students around elderly visits by way of visits to nursing homes or home visits should be a part of the curriculum. Students could also attend group events with the young old to see how vital they are. We need to integrate older adults into daily life, not hide them away or avoid them. People need to stop fearing going into senior living residences, like nursing homes.

The NYT has published about this federally funded program in the past and I believe it\u2019s a model of care that can be expanded beyond the current group of low-income older adults that typically qualify. It brings into play an interdisciplinary approach to care as even a geriatrician has limits to their knowledge and time when it comes to aspects of exercise, diet, living environments, mental health, and social/emotional/spiritual well-being that our team approach is able to address. And with the aging population (I just turned 55, which means I qualify for \u201csenior discounts at many popular eating establishments), we need a better model for care and I believe PACE could potentially be that one",
        "The medical profession in general often falls into the profitability trap. The public think of medicine ideologically, but the industry often does not. A decent society treats its most delicate with care.",
        "This essay misses another gaping hole besides physician care. There is a national crisis in direct support professionals (DSP\u2019s) who support the elderly and disabled. There are not enough young Americans entering the workforce to serve these populations. In between visits to the doctors as elderly decline they need support to live their best lives. Who is going to provide that when family can\u2019t? Who provides the 24/7 care DSP\u2019s the national average is less then $15 hour. Folks make more pumping gas or making your coffee. Much of that workforce are immigrants, and there are just not enough personnel to address the growing tsunami of elderly and disabled. It is something we should ALL be doing something about, as the vast majority of us will become disabled before we die and need supportive care. I believe we will be judged how we treat the most vulnerable among us-I don\u2019t think that judgement is looking very positive right now.",
        "Great article. It brings to mind a discussion with my late mother. I was her 24/7 primary caregiver for the last years of her life, We navigated healthcare thru covid and end of life. The focus seems to be the service of youth as sports medicine and anti-aging get the lions share of attention and funding. Ma was expressing her disdain for \"if you got it, flaunt it\", bent of a TV program. I pointed out to her \"ma, you know that people are young and beautiful for a very short time but are old and funny looking for a very long time. Let them them enjoy the glory days as they happen\". She thought about it, chuckled a bit and said your right. I held her hand as she passed and realized she was still beautiful even at 83.",
        "I can\u2019t even finish this article this is so New York. There are good doctors who take care of elderly people. They are called family physicians or general internists. We don\u2019t need every decade of life hyper specialized into a medical field. Yes we need more primary care doctors.",
        "This is an important and fixable problem. It is also a problem in geriatric psychiatry, which few psychiatrists are going into (via an extra fellowship training year) because of low Medicare reimbursement.",
        "I sent a friend of mine to a geriatrician at a renowned geriatric clinic in New York. He got no better care or attention than from the nurse practitioner at his GP.",
        "Thank you for this thoughtful, well-researched piece on a critical, yet woefully under-sung, issue. Healthcare delivery in the US is extremely fragmented, with each specialty, for the most part, operating within a silo. As we age, a holistic approach to health care is ever more critical, yet virtually nonexistent. As a result, older people, even those of us who are reasonably healthy for our age, are shunted from specialist to specialist, often at different locations, such that our lives revolve around setting up and getting ourselves to a myriad of appointments. Moreover, there is little cross communication, and no one who has an adequate \u201cbig picture.\u201d It is an incredibly inefficient way to deliver care. In my ideal world, we would not only have well-trained teams of geriatric physicians and allied professionals, including basic specialties, at a single, community-based location, but also an administrative system that could schedule basic preventive services ad seriatim on a single day\u2019s visit. That would require, however, putting the needs of people over making a big profit, a concept entirely foreign to our profit-driven health care industry.",
        "The most important part of taking care of elderly people which I would define as age 75 and up, is having family manage everything.",
        "I think it's in part due to our own country's ageism and the way health care providers (including those in training) internalize this themselves. The article does suggest this but doesn't call it out by name. Yet, the majority will go on to work with older people because older people constitute the greater portion of recipients of health care services.",
        "I'm a 73 year old Family Physician with a 33 year old independent solo practice.  About 15 years ago I had the son of an elderly patient ask me if I thought his dad should see a geriatrician.  I said absolutely; the good news is that he's already seeing one (me).  I have watched my practice age over the years and of course my patients as well.  Now I must spend much more time with my elderly patients, many of whom are in their 80's and 90's.  This is impossible in the crazy state of corporate control and for profit medicine.  PA's and NP's are overwhelmed by these patients.  I can only say that caring for elderly patients is immensely rewarding and growing with them from middle to old age is a lifelong geriatric residency.  I have no answers for the future care of our elderly.  I am not optimistic, but I for one I hope to practice 'til I'm 90.",
        "Being considered a geriatric, I hold myself responsible for care. I have a wonderful doctor I see every six months but don't believe it is his responsibility to keep me healthy. I go to the gym, have a healthy diet, stay social and enjoy an evening cocktail. My alternative is a nursing home where the care is usually poor as the health is too. People have to decide if they want to sit in front of a tv and complain or be part of society and have fun.",
        "Excellent essay.\n\nA key point is \"doctors must know how to prioritize among a mix of competing medical needs. Key to this model is allowing the patient to take the lead in complex treatment decisions where there isn\u2019t one clear better pathway.\"  This is very important.\n\nAs mentioned, doctors need to spend more time with elderly patients. They have more ailments and may be slower to understand directions.  But unfortunately, in modern medicine, there is great pressure on providers to spend less time with patients.  This includes doctors, nurses, and support staff--there are less people yet more work to do.  Some practices hire staff that really aren't qualified.\n\nAlso, practices are pushing more computer interaction, which is not satisfactory.  I just got an email \"we have an important medical message for you\".  So I log on to the system and it says again \"we have an important medical message for you\".  Ok, but where is the actual message?  I never could find it.  I'll try to call, but often they don't answer the phone and push patients to use the computer.  This isn't just one practice, many are doing it.  Likewise with pharmacies.",
        "I am now retired but over the years most of my patients were seniors, even though I never did a fellowship.  I really enjoyed the complex interactions of their multiple medical problems, life changes  and ongoing challenges.  I took care of these patients in the hospital, clinic and transitional care settings.  We need to encourage more primary care doctors to have more elderly patients, which can be extremely rewarding emotionally to both the patient and provider.  Thanks for bringing this up.",
        "This piece could have been twice as long.   I am caring for 2.5 elderly parents and 2 kids.  I also work.   Boomers created a massive amount of wealth that is not ever going to be replaced.  To a large degree they built this country.  We are coasting on their achievements and they deserve better.  Paul is correct, low pay is a problem, but not just for doctors.  Those who provide care are underpaid at every level.  Nursing home workers where I live make about $17/hr.  A starter home here costs about $550,000.  You do the math.",
        "I took the first ABIM geriatrics exam.  Maybe 1988. At that time you were awarded a certificate of what was it added or extra competence or interest in geriatric care, good for ten years. Is it now formal board certification in geriatric medicine as a subspecialty of Internal Medicine?   The ABIM continuing certification process for board certification has become so cumbersome, expensive, and demanding of time that I can\u2019t imagine a geriatrician could afford it.",
        "You're missing the forest for the trees here. We need more docs and nurses, period. The AMA, insurance companies, brokers, PBMs, lawyers, governments, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies all drain the healthcare system without adding enough value.\n\nWe need to streamline the whole fossilized system, get more docs and nurses, get basic universal care, lower drug costs, and get the middlemen (private equity, insurance, lawyers, PBMs, etc.) out of healthcare delivery.\n\nHealthcare in the US is dying and we are too. Check the mortality rates in other similar countries.",
        "This needs to be balanced with the fact that we aren't going to live forever. My father spent his last six months, at age 95, in a nursing home with which we had no issues. However, it seemed that many of the patients there were being warehoused waiting to die, with little or no likelihood of ever getting better and going home.\n\nIf faced with spending the rest of my life laying in a bed staring at a TV and waiting for someone to come to help me go the bathroom, I think I'd rather bring in my family, say goodbye, and go to sleep forever.",
        "\"Medicare reimburses at a lower rate than private insurance companies.\"  Hello there.  Medicare Advantage Plans created for the benefit of the health insurance companies are paying a very large part of the bills and reaping substantial profits from the taxpayer  - and has a advertizing campaign designed to make people think Medicare Advantage Plans suggesting that they are Medicare (they are not Traditional government monitored Medicare and they create problems goggle Medicare Advantage Plans fraud and Medicare Advantage plans denial of care.. both the subject of articles in this paper.)\n\n And well known, the very high drug prices a direct result of the GWBush Medicare part D legislation which does not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\n\nThe problem is a payment problem it seems.

        "After a career in disability advocacy, I am now immersed in learning elder care for my 93 year old parents.\n\nDisrespect by medical professionals (speaking in third person, no eye contact, speaking loudly while ignoring the need for lip reading) are just a few of my observations. It is not uncommon for me to redirect professionals or people, in general, to show more respectful behavior. (And my parents are pleasant.)\n\nDuring an office visit with my father who has dementia, an urology nurse practitioner sat BEHIND my father while explaining his condition. No anatomy charts on the wall for visual reference.

        "\"Geriatricians don't make much money \".  So many of these articles about a decline in the staffing of some medical field mention money, specifically the money the doctors are not making in that field.  Did they choose medicine to get rich or to help people live their best healthy lives? Getting real tired of the constant drum of profits over people.  Lots of variables that come into play here, I know that, but this constant need to prove value and ROI is tiring.",
        "Ms. Paul is deeply misinformed: nearly all doctors (except for pediatricians) are geriatricians.  Geriatrics as a board specialty is fading because all doctors who deal with adult problems overwhelmingly treat patients who are advanced in age, cognitively fading, and struggling with a multitude of problems (both medical and social) as well as lengthy and difficult medication regimens.",
        "By mid-century, half of us, Americans, will be geriatric. It means  for every retiree there will be only one working person. Conceivably, about half of these working people will work in roles associated with taking care of us, geriatrics. This leaves only 25% of population to the rest: children, cops, bus drivers, military. The math simply doesn't add up. The fact that we, as society, talk nothing of it is the classic ostrich approach. What does it do to the stock market (read: your retirement income)?  To our nation's sovereignty? To arts and crafts and industry? Please consider the above numbers thoughtfully. We are on the ever accelerating collision course with reality.",
        "Thank you for addressing this complicated and challenging issue. I would add a couple of things. We need to switch the order of the 4Ms to first what matters most for us seniors, second mobility, than mentation  and then access to medication. Of course we need to address the social determinants of health. Loneliness and isolation kill, especially in the elderly. Income, housing, transportation all key to keeping and making people healthy.",
        "I am in my 70's and recently switched to a so called Senior Doctor and could not be happier.  I do have some health challenges, as most people my age do, and she takes the time to explain alternatives as well as how any treatment will affect me.  I would hope that more doctors would take the time to get to know their patients no matter their age.",
        "Thank you, Ms. Paul.  I am a health care advocate for older adults and veterans.  It is rare that they get served by doctors who specialize in geriatric care.  Sans experience, many doctors have the same biases that the general public has--that somehow depression is just part of aging (it's not), that an older adult does not benefit from serious rehab after an accident (they do and it's crucial for recovery), or that the older adult does not know their own needs due to cognitive or physical decline.\n\nFortunately, there are many nurses, CNAs, SWs and activities personnel who have experience with older adults.  Most of it is learned on the job since social work schools focus on kids and teens, nursing students rarely focus on older adults, and the activities/rec therapists learn as they go.\n\nMemo to all:  None of us are getting out alive.  Care for people in any demographic the way you would want for yourself.  Yes, Ms. Paul, we need many more clinical staff members of all kinds with expertise in older adult care.",
        "I think back on my opportunities to work with elders with joy.  Elders have wisdom, strength, determination and spunk.  The extra time and effort bring far more satisfaction than working with the run of the mill patient.  \nIt is far more intellectually challenging, personally demanding and often frustrating BUT the rewards were huge, huge. \nI still think back on my patients...WW2 veterans, Vietnam War and Korean war veterans, wise women who have seen it all and will enlighten you if you are able to listen.  \nElder care is a gift to all of us all the way around.  Having worked intensively with children, teens, adults, I can assure upcoming medical professionals that their lives will be richer, more interesting, more satisfying if they embrace elder care.  \nGreat article, thanks.",
        "Elderly patients need good medical care.  But internists and cardiologists and neurologists have been caring for the elderly for years. Geriatrics is an example of medicine requiring more and more specialization.  It is certainly necessary for organ systems such as oncology, cardiology, etc.  But it seems superfluous to suggest that you need a special physician to understand the needs of the elderly.  Are we next to have super specialized geriatric cardiologists?"
