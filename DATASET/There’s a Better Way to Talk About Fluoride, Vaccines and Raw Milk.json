        "By the way, pretty much every attack on florides and vaccines that you read is a pack of lies. For example, EU countries don\u2019t generally add florides because they\u2019re naturally present in their water supplies, children\u2019s vaccines haven\u2019t had thimerosol in them for over twenty years, and so on. \n\nAnd it\u2019d be one thing if the shouters were willing to switch to the European-style diets that would help a lot with tooth decay, or accept the very strict regulations that the EU and its member countries impose on dairy farming so that raw milk cheeses and such ae pretty safe.\n\nBut they\u2019re not. They just believe that everybody should get to do as they please, and the devil take the hindermost. And you docs better fix my 300-pound husband who\u2019s had two MIs and now has covid because he wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated PDQ, or I\u2019m comin\u2019 back here with a gun.\n\nNot exaggerating all that much, really. These people will be screaming their heads off about how come CDC didn\u2019t do anything when the next pandemic rolls into town, and y\u2019all better get me my cure five minutes ago.\n\nYou\u2019ve been told that something bad by way of virus would come out of SE Asia for about 25 years now, and that it\u2019d probably be a coronavirus. Your response was to attack vaccines and publc health. \n\nIn humans, bird flu carries about a 50 percent death rate among identified cases. Your response is to scream about milk and egg prices and elect Trump.",
        "I\u2019ve noticed that every time I write about my negative response to the CoVid vaccine which resulted in a heart attack, my comment either isn\u2019t published or taken down soon after.  It\u2019s even noted in my cardiology since the evidence is abundantly clear it was the vaccine.  My PCP told me not to get the 2nd vaccine but I did because of public health messaging.  The public health agencies still refuse to acknowledge people like me and maintain that it is perfectly safe meaning that we did not get the care or advice we needed when we needed it.  MSM is complicit in this",
        "The thing that quacks like RFK the Extremely Junior offer is absolute certainty. The cause of the problem is absolutely certain, how things went wrong is absolutely certain, the fix is absolutely certain, the good outcome is certain. \n\nScience cannot offer that, because material reality doesn\u2019t work that way on any level. And that goes about triple for matters medical, because bodies are highly individual, the systems involved are incredibly complex and interactive\u2014and any doctor who promises you absolute certainty is a liar. \n\nThere\u2019s a nice illustration of this in \u201cTwister,\u201d as Bill Paxton tries to explain that no, the twister is not out to get you, sometimes things just go wrong, you can\u2019t completely predict them, you can\u2019t stop them all. \n\nThis terrifies people, so\u2026quackery. Even yelling accusations at docs and researchers helps ease their fears, because then they know for sure what went wrong and why.",
        "good article, i wish it was longer",
        "Imagine a doctor telling you he has a medication for your child that will help prevent tooth decay (along with regular flossing, brushing, and getting plenty of Vitamin C), the only trade-off is, the medication will lower your child's I.Q. by 7 points. \nThat's the difference between being a 103 I.Q student, and a 96 I.Q. student. Yes, it will put your child in the below average I.Q. category, but their smile will shine.",
        "The NYT just has published the brilliant article about the importance of nuance.  Yet the editorial trend of the NYT has to been follow the mass media pack and offer less nuance.",
        "I agree....and yet Americans are very, very bad at nuance. The recent election was deeply influenced by propaganda and misinformation coming from Republican-oriented sources. Americans are also badly educated about statistics and evidence.",
        "Nice article, but I would add that contextualization of quantitative estimates of risk is really helpful.  The cantaloupe comparison is anecdotal -- one salmonella outbreak--but likely to stick in peoples' minds, with the message \"raw milk is as safe as cantaloupe!\" Check my math, but it seems that that 0.01% of raw milk drinkers get sick each year--or one in 1000 will get sick each decade.  That's where we need contextualization: 768 out of 11 million *seems* tiny, but one in a thousand sounds like a lot.  Is the risk considered small because of the degree of illness or the prevalence of illness?  (If you could cut your chances of getting a particular cancer in the next decade from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 or 1 in a million doing something as simple as avoiding raw milk, that's a powerful piece of information)",
        "Trump has brought us back to 1775, Kennedy wants us to go back to the Dark Ages. There should be two healthcare systems in America: one for the antiVax crowd, paid for by them, and one for the people who want vaccines, paid for by them.  Why should I get MediCare based on anti-science?",
        "This article seems a bit like victim blaming to me, because it suggests that how scientists communicate is the main problem. It's true that scientists aren't generally trained to communicate to regular people. But the main problem is the increasing anti-science and anti-expert bias throughout our culture. When people are poorly educated, as Americans now are, thanks to the gutting of public schools (caused by funding private and religious schools with vouchers, thereby de-funding public schools), they gravitate toward authoritarianism and become suspicious of new information. Since science is ever-evolving, based on new information, they become suspicious of science. As we enter an era of fascism, it does not help that the media incessantly label those with an education as \"elites.\" Elites are CEOs and billionaires, not scientists, artists, or those who are highly educated, most of whom are at most middle class. And guess what? They aren't responsible for the sucking sound you hear: that's money being sucked up by Elon Musk and the bros.",

        "So many of the people I\u2019ve met who are against the Covid vaccines Never took a college level science or statistics course, yet were suddenly experts. I\u2019ll follow science every day vs these social media hucksters.",
        "I absolutely agree with the point made by this article. It is something I noticed especially with information on COVID 19 and the development of those vaccines. In the beginning of the pandemic real information was being made available by scientists, medical people and the government, wanting to rapidly give everyone the best tools available to combat the disease and stay healthy. Then in several stages the information was withdrawn. We are not conspiracy theorists when we make choices about our health based on our personal situation, values and our understanding of the information we seek out. Or when we speak up about this or advocate about it. \n\nIt\u2019s a wider problem in health care as well, with most information for patients provided in a way that stubbornly refuses to answer questions or provide the reasons for recommendations. I am encouraged by my current primary care provider who does give reasoning and a medical specialist she has referred me to whose website materials don\u2019t insult my intelligence. \n\nI also think it\u2019s a wider problem in our politics that we have the Rs as radical party of the far right and Ds as institutionalists leaving no room for an intelligent body politic. So perhaps the Ds as well as the Rs are afraid of democracy.",
        "I have never spent a minute of my life worried about the fluoride in my tap water, which I do drink on a regular basis. But I will admit that this seems to me like a poor approach to public health. I'm fine with vaccine mandates for schools or work, but somebody can avoid those. It may not be easy, but you can find a private school, you can get another job. But just putting medicine in the water supply seems like a bad idea, even if it is safe.",
        "\u201cthe dose matters\u201d\n\nThis is what\u2019s lost on people. Ever seen a proposition 65 sign outside a restaurant? That\u2019s because grilling meat can create carcinogens. Not at a dangerous level, but that sort of thing is lost on the politicians in Sacramento. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like fluoride, don\u2019t drink the tap water. \n\nDrink whatever sort of milk you like. \n\nThe vaccination topic becomes trickier because of herd immunity. Manufacturers could do themselves a favor and stop using mercury as a preservative due to the optics though. That said, if RFK actually knew what causes autism he would\u2019ve already retired extremely wealthy.",
        "RFK Jr. is not an authority, but he appeals to people who want their anti-vax, anti-pas, anti-F prejudices confirmed.  One of those is DJT, who is opposed to anything he didn\u2019t think of (vaccines \u2026).  The problem is that Trump\u2019s endorsement of RFK\u2019s insanity gives a patina of legitimacy to Trump\u2019s supporters.  And when their kids\u2019 dental bills skyrocket, they\u2019ll find someone else to blame - almost certainly Nancy Pelosi.  And in states like Iowa, where all power emanates from the Golden Dome of Wisdom in Des Moines, the Witch of Terrace Hill will ban fluoride treatment throughout the state.",

We\u2019re headed to some place before science and before the Enlightenment, whose ideas were foundational to our country. Republicans want an ignorant electorate and will do whatever it takes to ensure that they get it.",
        "The problem is that \u2018science\u2019 gets bought. We are also sicker than ever since being corralled into one approach to our health, abandoning all our ancestral knowledge that kept our forebears so robust. When we question why, we are labelled recalcitrant. If medications worked, we wouldn\u2019t need repeats. What health problem was ever caused by the lack of a pharmaceutical medication so why we do we use these to treat health problems? Why not government-funded preventive medicine i.e nutritionists, microbiologists/gut specialists, naturopathy, physical therapies, mental health therapies, health programs that alleviate social isolation in the elderly, as we see in Asian countries? The monetary savings to Western governments of creating healthier populations would be beyond measurable so why wouldn\u2019t they? Our current version of a \u2018health system\u2019 really isn\u2019t one.",

His advances in germ theory made safe, clean surgery a reality.\n\nNobody in this country remembers polio epidemics, tuberculosis, dysentery, scarlet fever or a host of other diseases science has neutralized.\n\nGet ready to see them all return to the average American.  Brace yourselves.",
        "Many issues with vaccines and other health public health topics are the result of citizens never having seen the impacts of the diseases targeted by vaccines.  For example, regarding raw milk, my mother remembers neighbors of hers getting diptheria (can be fatal) likely from unpasteurized milk on the ranches.  She herself (and siblings) caught, and was impacted for a lifetime by, polio.  Measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough-- some of those may cause miscarriage and damage to fertility or hearing, and YOU may spread it to someone more vulnerable.  Also frustrating is the high rate of non-vaccination in well to do, highly-educated areas such as the bay area CA or even here in the Seattle area with all its biotech and research hospitals.  This sounds uncaring, but perhaps some people who refuse vaccines need to experience the effects of these diseases themselves or on their children.  Also, there should be no religious or personal belief exemptions (i may feel the earth is flat, but that doesn't mean it is) for vaccines, only physical.  How selfish to cause risk in others.",
        "One way to reduce skepticism of vaccines is to remove the liability shield and have an independent agency do follow-up studies.",
        "My understanding  is fluoride may help topically on the teeth but ingesting it is linked to lower IQ. \nA lawyer sued the FDA over fluoride and won because the FDA could not produce any studies proving fluoride to be safe or efficacious.",
        "As someone who has lost trust in our public health agencies, I agree with your premise but remain skeptical. You write \"while evidence on the impact of municipal water in the United States is more limited than ideal\", you later say \"water fluoridation...is safe at the levels we use in the United States\". Which is it... thoroughly evaluated or not? If yes, how long ago?\n\nRe the measles vaccine, you write \"concern about autism has been conclusively debunked\".  I keep hearing that, but have yet to read about any conclusive studies to back that claim.  Have public health agencies tried to identify the cause of the dramatic rise in cases of autism in the US?  If not, why not?  It will be hard to convince people that obstetric &/or pediatric meds/vaccines are safe without research to back it up.\n\nYes, our public health agencies lost a lot of trust during the pandemic! Here's an example:  Pfizer's brief outlining drug trial protocols for the first Covid vaccine (EUA) states that if a trial participant had a negative reaction to the first dose they were to be dropped out of the study (for the participant's safety), and data pertaining to their negative reaction was not to be included in the study results.  How is that science?  Data on higher rates of negative reaction to the Covid vaccine among people with certain underlying conditions or in certain age groups is still not public.  \n\nThen there's the controversy re CDC downplaying Lyme disease.  The list goes on.",
        "Thank you for sharing the nuanced information around these issues, I appreciate it.  My fear is that too many of my fellow citizens ignore any advice, nuanced or not.  We have as a whole embraced a \u2018mess around and find out\u2019 philosophy.  Too many died from COVID when they messed around with CDC guidelines and avoided vaccines or used animal health products to treat COVID.  They found out.  Wanna drink raw milk? Perhaps, you\u2019ll find out why pasteurization is so prevalent.  Are tariffs the way to stem inflation? Economists across the board say no and have explained why\u2026 we\u2019re all about to find out why that is.  Let\u2019s hope for our next foray into \u2018mess around\u2019 town that the \u2018find out\u2019 phase is with relatively minor inconveniences versus more serious/permanent outcomes.

        "The written history of infectious disease and untimely sepsis deaths should scare us into being smarter somehow.  Drinking raw milk collected from barnyard animals might seem safe until you scrape the hoof of a dairy cow and grow the matter into untold lots of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. The problem isn't your unsafe milk drinking habit but the inconvenience that happens when you're taken to the hospital with a burning fever and contaminating the facility and killing others as well.  If you'd just stay home and   expire and have a cousin wearing an infectious disease protection suit burn everything then enjoy the milk.",
        "The fluoride ion F- occurs naturally in some water sources, and in soil is believed to promote fossilization of bones and teeth after burial of a dead animal. \u201cSeismosaurus: The Earth Shaker,\u201d a book by David Gillette, has a nice discussion of this in connection with the specimen found by three hikers in New Mexico in the 1970s. F- can substitute for hydroxyl groups in hydroxyapatite, the calcium phosphate mineral in bones and teeth, hardening them and making them less soluble and more resistant to breakdown by acids. The substituted mineral is called fluorapatite. We have acid-forming bacteria in our mouths that cause tooth decay, and in adults, erosion of the tooth sockets of jawbones in periodontal disease.\n\nToo much fluoride is bad, leading to grayish discoloration or brittleness, and special high-fluoride toothpastes for treating tooth demineralization require a prescription. But it\u2019s not added to drinking water at such levels, and unlikely in US naturally fluoridated water sources, which are tested. Fluorosis damaging bones is rare here. I doubt the Senate would confirm RFK, Jr., a non-physician with no experience in public health administration, as FDA commissioner or Secretary of HHS. Unlike judicial nominees, he could be filibustered. But Trump may have him around the White House as a sort of \u201chealth czar.\u201d Gad.",

        "Dr. Oster is among my \"heroes,\" but I think that her 2 takeaways - as I read them - include one winner & one loser:\n\nYES, one does well to distinguish between situations where there are relatively modest costs & benefits - in this article, \"raw milk\" seems to be closest to \"meh\" - and those with higher stakes.\n\nBut - inconceivable that she's unmindful of the election results of 8 days ago - \"give people more than the bottom line\"?? There was a time when \"You can't handle the truth\" was frequently quoted.\n\nToday, \"you [i.e., most people] can't handle complexity\" seems to be inarguable. People who \"believe in science\" - that 30-50% in the U.S. basically don't should scare one nearly senseless - almost always go along with even \"let's avoid some smaller risks while we're at it,\" and the others have very nearly gotten to a point where \"If those elitist/experts coalesce around X, I'm inclined to act in the opposite way!\"\n\nAnybody who's ever argued - could that be me? - knows that sometimes \"more facts\" looks like \"talking down\" to the other person, and I think that - all by itself - delivered a few million votes to DJT this year.\n\nAnd Dr. Oster doesn't say it, but health experts got enough wrong during Covid years [Nate Cohn mentions that today as an extremely potent '24 election reality] for them to deliver their recommendations with patent \"humility\" and low-key-ness!

        "This all sounds very reasonable. However, I question Kennedy\u2019s ability to make decisions based on his lack of back ground in public health and his link to an administration that wants to roll back regulations that protect the public. I went to college in the 70s an area where there were dairy farmers who had contracted TB from  drinking raw milk in the 30s and 40s. Cows weren\u2019t tested or certified back in the day. Food regulations are there for a reason.\n\nKennedy thinks it\u2019s fine to take the decaying corpse of a dead bear and dump it in a public area. Let\u2019s not get started on exposing his kids to whale head goo. I\u2019d like the person in charge of the nation\u2019s health to be a rational human being.

Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Certain activities were closed down, while others which seemed to be similar were not closed.

        "This piece reduces the enormous (impossible?) challenge and complexity that public health officials face in messaging to \"Being more nuanced will not be easy for public health agencies\". What public health agencies know is that transparency with the public about the public health issues of the day will harm public health. The general population cannot objectively weigh risk, as economists have proven. So, the public health agencies downplay, dissemble about, and publicly ignore problems with treatments that they have decided cannot be released without a negative impact on public health.\nThey make these decisions unilaterally, without public understanding or consent, and without the agreement of the people, for the good of the people. So for example, the COVID vaccine is rumored to have all sorts of side effects - cardia events, rashes, Bell's palsy, etc., etc.  A large HMO like Kaiser Permanente has all of the data to address these rumors - but they will never release it, because all vaccines have non-specific effects, and in the view of the public health establishment the general populace is incapable of making an objective risk assesment about whether those non-specifc effects outweigh the benefits from taking the vaccine.\nMost importantly, this power to suppress infomration for the good of the public is never discussed. The public, and its elected representatvies in Congress, don't get to weigh in. How do you feel about that?",

Unpasteurized dairy products thus cause 840 times more illnesses and 45 times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products. As consumption of unpasteurized dairy products grows, illnesses will increase steadily; a doubling in the consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese could increase outbreak-related illnesses by 96%.\"",

And those in the MAGA universe are being fed a steady stream of negative press regarding government agencies and other institutions that has made it easier to pass off misinformation under the guise of free speech.

But most of the working class, seriously hurt by inflation, voted for him  because they remembered what the economy was like when he was president.

        "Emily Oster makes a claim with no evidence -- that giving the public \"nuanced\" detailed, data-filled explanations on health risks such as raw milk consumption, will make the public and especially the skeptics more accepting of the really crucial things like vaccines. She offers no evidence that this method would work, and she further undermines her point by using misleading data about raw milk consumption  as it currently stands -- highly regulated and narrowly distributed -- to show that loose or no regs (as RFK Jr. wants) on wide distribution would result in low risk, not acknowledging that wider distribution of raw milk would introduce significant public health  risk. In other words, risk is lot different when dinking very fresh raw milk right on the farm vs. raw milk that is  being transported and is many days old when it reaches the market, after the bacteria has grown exponentially.

        "I think a lot of the paranoia about vaccines is because the messaging is \"they're safe!\" as if there is nothing more to it. In reality, it is not that no one is hurt by vaccines - some are. It is that vastly more people are hurt by not having vaccines than by vaccines - so many that the comparison makes the number of people hurt *statistically* meaningless. But it's not meaningless to the people who are hurt. So it is demonstrably false that *no one* is hurt, and because the information is presented as absolute, it both leaves people feeling misled and makes people distrust the source. I cringed during the pandemic when people said that no one would be hurt by the COVID vaccine - clearly some were. You could not know until you had it whether you'd be one of the unlucky few for whom it was quite harmful. \n\nI have my doubts as to whether a more nuanced presentation can be heard in the midst of the absolutist propaganda, but clearly the current way of presenting this information is not working. \n\nIt will be stupid to take fluoride out of the water, but if we do, those who are afraid of fluoride won't take supplements and those who are will.

        "There are valid points for all of Kennedy's  long overdue proposals. All we need to do is look to the EU to see what they ban. Many countries in the EU don't use fluoride in the water supply and provide it in things like salt to protect children. Due to body size, they consume more of it than adults. Fluoride is controversial, but with studies showing that it can lead to cancer, it is worth consideration and more studies, since the cancer rates accelerated with the use of fluoride in the water supply. \nRaw milk has many advantages over pasteurized milk for people with asthma, eczema, autoimmune disorders, or problems with gut health, especially after antibiotic treatment. People who are lactose intolerant can drink it without problems. It should be available to anyone who wants to buy it. Raw milk is at the opposite end of the spectrum from ultra processed food and should be an option, for those who believe that natural is better for health. \nVaccines and many other aspects of our children's well being need to be considered more. Our rates of autism are now 2.8%, or 1 out of 36 children. We don't know why this is happening, but the EU only has half of these numbers. One difference in our vaccines is that the EU is the banned mercury from theirs. Here vaccines are only mercury free by request. While mercury probably has nothing to do with our autism rates, there's a reason the EU has banned this and many other substances that we use daily in the US. This needs to change.",

It's not that people have stopped trusting science, it's that people have caught on to how our political system is so rotten that decisions like water fluoridation can't be trusted, because common sense says that if you want to improve dental health, then encourage people to brush their teeth. Instead, Americans think that public health measures like water fluoridation and mandatory vaccination are going to fix everything.

Vaccines are studied to look at the outcome of one vaccine at a time and in the real world that doesn't happen. Anyone with a child can tell you they get multiple vaccines in short periods of time. And they just keep adding new ones to the schedule without seeing if they interact with each other. 4. Most people feel coerced into vaccinating on a strict schedule and because of that they reject all vaccines. If you gave people more education about the benefits and risks of each vaccine and more choice on when to give each one you would have better uptake.",
        "Perhaps public health should make recommendations with degrees of uncertainty built in, similar to a weather forecast.  People understand the difference between a 20% chance of rain vs. a 100% chance.\n\nFor example, there could be a scale going from 1 to 5 for both efficacy (or health benefits) and safety.  A number 1 would mean that taking the medication or treatment is ineffective (or unhealthy) or dangerous.  A number 5 would mean the treatment is safe and effective.\n\nFor example, most vaccines would score a 5 on both safety and efficacy meaning they are both safe and effective.  Drinking raw milk might be a 3 for efficacy (neither healthy nor unhealthy) but a 2 for safety (slightly unsafe).  That way, nuance could be conveyed while also being simple.",

First,  she does not note that the study she links shows most people who drink raw milk are treating it as a novelty: only 1% of the 4% of Americans who drink it do so once a week or more. Consuming a higher-risk food is like playing dietary Russian roulette: the more often you do it, the more likely you are to get sick. In addition, states that allow the sale of raw milk on more than a direct to consumer basis have more stringent requirements for its production than for pasteurized milk. California is one of those states, and has very stringent regulations. Given its large population, I'd bet a big percentage of the people who drink raw milk live there. Finally, when considering making a recommendation on higher-risk foods, public health experts consider who is most likely consume it. Who consumes the most milk in our country? Kids. Who is more likely than other groups to become very sick from food-borne illnesses? Also kids.",

And I know two people, 15 years or so my elder, who have spent their entire adult lives in wheelchairs after polio permanently paralyzed them.\n\nI suspect it will take only a few localized but devastating outbreaks of polio or measles to reappear in this country for much of our vaccine-skepticism to swept away.

Yet nearly all are to articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals; no links are provided, but it wouldn't really matter, since most are behind paywalls, and (at least based on my own experience) aren't easy for non-specialists to follow, much less evaluate.\n\nThus we're stuck--those given to trust \"the experts\" find this convincing, those given over to skepticism (or conspiracy theories) will see it as a smokescreen.",

        "As a pediatrician, I fully agree with Ms. Oster.  The CDC, FDA, USDA and other agencies that make health pronouncements have a tendency to make simplified, blanket recommendations about health, without providing context or nuance.  Many people in their target audience will feel condescended to.\n\nAn excellent example is the CDC's initial recommendations that masking was unnecessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Along with the early failure to approve testing kits, and the inability to monitor the spread early enough, such pronouncements made their subsequent recommendations (like vaccination) less credible; this suspicion of recommendations led to a million or more preventable deaths.\n\nUnfortunately, many physicians also fail to present the nuances of their recommendations, and thus come across as condescending or patronizing.\n\nThe opposing forces, including the RFK's of the world, ALSO fail to provide context or nuance.\n\nBut it's important to make a distinction.  If people want to avoid fluoride, but allow folks who want it to get it from their doctor, I think that's understandable (although I disagree).  When they make those choices, at least no one else is at risk.\n\nBut the same can't be true of unpasteurized milk or avoiding vaccines.  If your kid gets TB from unpasteurized milk, they put everybody in their school at risk from getting it.  The same is true of avoiding vaccines (such as measles vaccines).\n\nCitizens have an obligation to protect each other!",

It also contains enzymes and probiotics that support gut health. \nI buy it at my local market - it will last a week - and it is far better than truly unhealthy things like oat or almond milk.\n\nRFK, Jr. is also right about the number of toxic ingredients in many American products - cereals, juices, teas, etc. - ingredients that many countries ban. \n\nIt pains me to say that this is why Trump won: because of the arrogance - and, in some cases, outright ignorance - about common sense matters of health.",

I preface this by saying that I am a strong advocate for vaccines (PhD in Immunology/Virology and years of clinical research). I am \u201celderly\u201d (74) and though active. I have had 7 doses of the Moderna vaccine through 2023. I have had Covid twice. I\u2019ve been telling my friends that their T cell immunity after vaccination will keep them from developing severe, life-threatening Covid. But T cell immunity is technically difficult to study, so current recommendations are based solely on antibody levels against the Covid spike proteins which don't say much about total immunity. I worry slightly about a low but real incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis, mostly in young men, but haven\u2019t seen anything about the effects in older individuals. My risk might be a higher WITH the next vaccine dose than without it - plus I am one of those who suffer 2 days of aches and fatigue after the mRNA vaccines. I will forgo the latest update and consider a protein-based vaccine in a few months.",

Freedom and civil rights are meaningless if we're dead.  \n\nThe data was confusing in the beginning.  But Trump and others didn't allow for that.  The first word had to be correct.  If it wasn't because the information had changed, Trump decided that the people supplying the information were unreliable.  They did the best they could with the information they had.  \n\nAs for the schools and teachers, they too did their best given how many parents felt that wearing masks was an imposition.  Never mind that teachers may not be in perfect health or have family members they didn't want to infect.  That didn't matter to the parents.  School days were free daycare.  Had parents behaved like adults, students would have been back in school sooner.  \n\nAs someone who has worked in scientific research I can say that one thing hasn't changed over the years:  Americans are unwilling to understand science no matter how minimal the effort might be.  I would say one three syllable word concerning my work and friends eyes would glaze over.  They'd whine about how they couldn't understand it.  They could have.

Through treatment, she eventually recovered but it was well over a year. My friend has never had another vaccine given to her children or herself.

Knowledge builds upon itself. Over time, some baseline level of knowledge becomes expected when professionals talk to one another. That's why they come up with new words- to save time by allowing them to express themselves more concisely.\n\nSo explaining things in a way that laypeople could understand is difficult because that has to involve unraveling the jargons in the profession. Doing that might be a nice way to check if one actually understands the term that one is using, but it's exhausting all the same.\n\nAs such, as matter of practicality, there's limit to how much experts can respond to random ideas that people come up with. People can pick ideas off the thin air and hurl them all around in matter of minutes or seconds; trying to think of ways to explain why those ideas are wrong or are poorly supported takes much more effort and time.\n\nSo we prioritize. We assess the credibility of ideas that people come up with. We ask for their sources, we ask if they did their homework in at least trying to understand what the experts are saying, and we dismiss poorly supported ideas. I think the question is whether we do that well, not whether we do that in first place. Who really listens to every single advertisement out there to see if products will make their life better?",

If you extrapolate your #s to the full US population, that would be more like 26,000 illnesses per year.  Granted, that's an oversimplification, but your argument that raw milk doesn't cause much illness is an even worse simplifcation.\n\nFinally, once the restrictions on raw milk are lifted, we will likely see larger dairies, which mix milk from numerous source cows, supplying raw milk across the country.",
        "Public health agencies lack nuance in their messaging and policies so when evidence in contrast to  their messaging emerges it creates distrust and resistance of the message.\n\nTake the CoVid vaccine.  I had a severe case of CoVid in 2020 that affected my heart and colon (not my respiratory system).  I had an adverse reaction to the first set of vaccines that set up a case of long CoVid affecting my heart.  My PCP told me not to get the second set of vaccines.  Meanwhile other medical providers insisted my health problems were not due to the vaccine. Because of the public health messaging to do the right thing and get vaccinated, I ignored my PCPs advice and got vaccinated again with disastrous results that ultimately ended in a heart attack, sleep apnea and a fib.  At 68 I have been an athlete my whole life and as one friend told me, \u201cI thought you were indestructible\u201d. Stress tests and a CT scan showed the artery clear that clogged up 10 months later.  They are listening now. But Public health agencies still suppress messaging that the CoVid vaccine can be dangerous for some. \n\nMy undergraduate degree is in nutritional science.  I go to a dairy to buy (not ultra) pasteurized  milk and think raw milk is dangerous to consume unless it has first been scalded like when I make yogurt or cheese because of disease risk.

Milk is boiled before consumption for safety, and I have never heard anyone get sick from it. But milk that is packaged for sale at stores has to be pasteurized, no argument there. I guess the question is, does US prevent people from consuming raw milk at their own farm? If yes, that is overreach.\n\nRegarding fluoride, sounds like it\u2019s absorbed by enamel, and does not need to be ingested for its benefit. If there is a remote chance that it is harmful then why take a chance? Why not let people take responsibility for their dental hygiene?",

Let Americans do their own \"research\" and decide for themselves how to handle their own health. They already rely on podcasters and influencers more than they do public health experts, so just get rid of the experts. Let them drink whatever milk they want, get vaccinations or not, add fluoride to their water themselves if they want it. Eliminate the NIH and FDA, since nobody trusts them anyway. As for the Human Services area, it administers Medicare and Medicaid, which is going to run out of money anyway, so just let some other agency handle it until the funds are gone. And, while he's at it, Trump should eliminate FEMA. After natural disasters, people just complain about how FEMA handles things, so get rid of it altogether. In fact, get rid of all federal agencies. Let the states handle things however they want, or better yet just let people figure stuff out for themselves with no government interference at all.

Popular reliance on TikTok and other digital media instead of carefully vetted and edited news sources during our recent election support that. But, it is those same, simplistic messages on digital media which have led people to distrust vaccines and fluoridation.\n\nSo perhaps there should be 2 (or even 3!) levels of information: 1) The basic, \"this is good\", or \"this is bad\" that we currently have, 2) a more nuanced view, citing the degree of risk, supporting the current conclusion, but also acknowledging some evidence to the contrary, and 3) detailed citations to online studies.\n\nFor instance, re fluoridation: Current evidence is overwhelming that fluoridated water is safe and dentally beneficial at current levels of fluoridation.

I wouldn\u2019t! Mechanistically, it inhibits the enzymes responsible for the production of glutathione in the brain. Glutathione is one of our most important antioxidants. At only 2x the recommended level in water it has been shown to lower iq. Lower IQ is a big side effect! We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing at lower levels yet.

People say, You make your choices; I'll make mine.  Live and let live.  Live free or die.

To take up just the raw milk issue, the link that might support her point on tuberculosis is to a history-of-science study on the pasteurization campaign in Chicago, 1908-1916.  At the time, researchers believed that much TB in children was bovine TB.  Both the pasteurization campaign and later cattle vaccination programs grew from this belief.  One of the surprises of ancient DNA research is the rarity of bovine TB in people, both in the distant past and more recently.  Nevertheless, pateurization kills food contamination organisms.  It increases the \"safe before\" range for refrigerated milk, just as irradiation vastly increases the shelf life of \"refrigerate after opening products.\"\n    I have consumed raw milk for much of my life, but I've lived in rural areas and kept my own livestock.

As a very small sample (my family), fluoride did not protect my teeth from numerous cavities, but my children, who are now young adults, have been cavity-free without any fluoride at all, not even in their toothpaste.

In my own risk-benefit analysis, I know the raw milk we buy is safe because I know the farmer; I regularly see his calm, clean, happy cows (whose bodies are in great condition); I know their diet is mostly grass (and hay in winter), and that they graze in different spots to damper parasites; and I know that he tests his milk for bacteria counts. I would never buy or consume raw milk without knowing this kind of information. \n\nThis nuance is crucial but missing from a lot of the conversations around raw milk. The price and convenience that Americans expect when procuring their foods, including milk, requires scale and regulations that are not always conducive to freshness and, therefore, safety.  I think if we want to be able to drink raw milk safely, we to be on board with raising costs, so farmers have the resources they need to prioritize the health and safety of their cows and milk \u2014 and oversight, so inspectors can evaluate the milk for bacteria and viruses that could make consumers sick.",

These are the facts.",
        "Humans are fully capable of understanding the public health risks being addressed by current policies if they would focus on facts and leave their imaginations aside. But they do not, and so bad outcomes from ignoring honest and informed experts result, often to innocent children.",
        "\"However, the number of illnesses are small.\"\n\nThe number of illnesses IS small. The number is small.",
        "There is entirely too little scientific literacy in the country. We definitely need to increase our educational levels so people can understand why vaccines are safe and how to tell if the data shows that they are ineffective or unsafe. The irony is that Trump wants to eliminate the Department of Education, an organization that could be used to promote better science education in the US.",
        "I have been a physician for 45 years. During the pandemic I spent most of my time in the iCU helping to care for dying patients. I got the COVID vaccine as soon as it was available. When I see patients who are refusing vaccines I used to ask why? What I heard was a litany of ignorance, superstition, political propaganda and conspiracies. Now when I discuss vaccines with patients and they tell me they don't believe in vaccines I simply say \"That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard\". These are not people who are amenable to education.",
        "Nuance in the NYT would indeed be a good idea.\n\nWe should judge an idea on its merits, rather than who suggested it.",
        "As a result of bureaucratic bungling, water in the city of Buffalo contained no fluoride from June 2015 to September 2024. I wish some organization with resources and authority to collect this dataset and use it to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluoride in a US setting.",
        "Why don't you mention the risks of raw milk during pregnancy?  \n\nWhen I visited a friend in France while pregnant, she mentioned that her French OB strongly recommended she only eat pasteurized dairy products and avoid fresh greens and vegetables unless she knew they were washed well, preferably by her.  The risks were listeria and toxoplasmosis, infections that a healthy adult probably wouldn't even notice, but that could irreparably harm a fetus. \n\nRaw milk and cheese is practically a religion in France but I took her warnings seriously.  It was a trip that was memorable for reasons other than food--I've never eaten so much overcooked spaghetti bolognese in my life!",
        "Excellent points. You'd probably want to have a severity level for public health recommendations, just like for hurricanes. If people got the same kind of urgent evacuation warnings for a small tropical storm as for a cat 5 hurricane, nobody would trust those warnings anymore.\n\nIf you follow social media frequented by young progressives, you realize that many of them seriously believe that if we stopped vaccinating all children against measles and everybody drank raw milk, virtually everybody would die. They really think it would be millions of dead. This in turn makes those people look ridiculous to the skeptics, who know that plenty of people drink raw milk and are unvaccinated and didn't die. It's an elevated and unnecessary risk but not a huge one. Measles are dangerous, but still 999 out of 1000 infected children do not die from it - growing up with an anti-vaccine mother, I was one of them. Hiding these facts doesn't help anybody.",
        "Very interesting and good! What a terrible headline title and graphic, though! Enough with condescension! (\"You're talking about it all wrong! Here, let us....\") How about: \"Some information about...\" \n\nGiven the mood of the country, as recently expressed, find a new tone, please.",
        "Measles. When I grew up (back in the dark ages) there was no measles vaccine. We all got measles and no one died or even had any difficulty. I have no problem with a measles vaccine now, but you need to look at the CDC's chart of recommended childhood vaccinations. They want NEWBORNS to be vaccinated IMMEDIATELY for a sexually transmitted disease even if there is no reason to do so. Common sense is needed rather than whatever Big Pharma thinks will make them a buck.  By the way, most of the conspiracy theories about COVID turned out to be true.",
        "the irony of this article about arguing for more nuance and not dumbing down science is that it is an op-ed and by definition dumbed-down...\n\nWhile I see the author's point about nuance, and agree with it in an ideal world, I think she misses the fact that she has probably spent half her life sifting through research papers and analysis as an economist and doesn't acknowledge that she is arguing from this lens. That the grand majority of the public doesn't have this experience. Nuance would be great if the audience wasn't getting their news from tiktok, Instagram reels, etc. \n\nPublic Health does have a communication problem. The answer isn't to communicate more pedantic science like the author's argument leads you to conclude, but to communicate in ways in which the audience is consuming information. Basically, meet people where they are at."
