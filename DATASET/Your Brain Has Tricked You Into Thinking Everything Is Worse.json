        "Are things better today in America than in the past?\n\nI think America today basically aims at and elevates to aim at boring and mediocre and average people, average emotions and average thoughts, the predictable, the banal, people as predictable as highway gas stations and fast food restaurants.\n\nAthletes and entertainers who connect with the most people, businesses that can be spread wide and thin, it's a predictable and controllable palette of thoughts and emotions. The worst sin is anything in which not everybody can partake, the worst sin the deeply original, strange, and beautiful and complex of thought, that which doesn't spread easily and bring in money.\n\nIt's as if every business instinct is to guess the new average of a crowd, the new fad, where the herd will move next, and be there with something that you can make a profit on. Even better is to predict in advance herd instinct and form the herd in that direction. But what this leads to is first of all people who are attractive in appearance and who soon disappoint the instant they make the mistake of opening their mouths and voicing their emotions and opinions, because they can't help being fundamentally banal, middling, what everyone knows in the first place.\n\nAmerica really is a strange country these days, a place where we elevate people with no real mystery, nothing of deep interest, but we gather around them as if they're oracles or something. The land of the perfectly banal and expert and educated oracle.",
        "Is the following an expression of envy from an experimentalist who knows and has experienced along with chemists and physicists the great care that may be required to create the conditions for a single or single pair of critical measurements? And who knows that no matter the difficulty in repeating the procedures for those measurements, they are critical to the reasoning and the finding?\n\n\u201cWe first collected 235 surveys with over 574,000 responses total and found that, overwhelmingly, people believe that humans are less kind, honest, ethical and moral today than they were in the past.\u201d\n\nNah, yet another psychologist with N -vy, who, out of the gate uses the statistical bludgeon to erect the illusion of a great straw person.",

But when the author defines that \"everything\" it turns out to be some loosely defined \"state of morality.\" No, the headline didn't bring that to mind. It brings to mind the rise in armed conflict in the world, such as the Ukraine war, and the devastated planet, or the rise of fascism in the US and elsewhere. It brings to mind boats of desperate people fleeing to safety and earning their deaths instead. It brings lots of things to mind but not whether the \nguy behind the counter was being polite today.",

Trump's motives for keeping secret documents no doubt were to cash in on them somehow and his corruption has existed for decades.\nTrump's cult admires his ability to get away with so many crimes and lives grand never paying for his crimes with his armies of lawyers he lies to, uses to commit more crimes and doesn't pay. What do Evangelicals find so attractive about Trump he seems to be the opposite of every value Jesus preached at the sermon on the mount.",
        "This argument is similar to one often heard from a certain subset of technocrats who claim that technology is neutral, and only becomes \"good\" or \"bad,\" depending on how it's used. Somehow this argument ignores the underlying motivators for so much technological development: Profit and  Power, leading to technologies like the internet, (which functions simultaneously as a massive propaganda device --including mass media and social media-- a massive surveillance apparatus, and a massive marketing device promoting mass consumption at a time when we are extinguishing life on earth), and advanced weapons technologies, which day to day seek to hold the world hostage to the threat of the red button and all its lesser kin.

Trump, McCarthy and MAGA give them that - and it is totally fake. I am old enough to remember the \"old days\".\n\nYes, in many ways they were more secure but also much worse. I remember hiding under my desk in grade school in case of n atomic bomb attack. I remember HAND WASHING laundry and hanging it outside to dry, no-gear bicycles, a telephone any color as long as it was black and had separate mic and ear piece. I remember the first \"Stereo\" turntable and the advent of seat belts, and McCarthy. I remember friends being killed in Vietnam and in the South of THIS country fighting for freedom. I even remember Korea and the Cuban missile crisis. \n\n\"Good\" time? NOT. I remember blatant racist oppression of Italians, Blacks, Poles and Jews by \"good\" Christians - still here and practiced. I remember LYNCHINGS, separate schools, and massive poverty of Blacks. SEGREGATION.\n\nI KNOW the lies of Trump an MAGA and what they do to bring these \"good days\" back again - especially the oppression.

Are we to think for one moment that San Francisco was a less egalitarian and less interesting place---and much more friendly and vital back then?\n\nOur neighbor delivered milk and he had 3 kids, a stay at home wife, and a family summer house at Lake Tahoe.  Another was a union carpenter with his family's ram-shackle beach home that the familiar would retreat to any given weekend. \n\nAnd then these authors should be deeply questioned about their humanly chauvinistic out look:  I can assure them that those who consider sharing this planet with the splendor of life, do not share this rosy viewpoint.\n\nEvery ecologist and biologic scientist I know is utterly depressed about the disrespect of which we treat the natural world.  Are we to think that the loss of 90% of our wetlands is something beneficial?  Or the wholesale cutting of tropical rainforest, or the depletion of the ocean's fishes.?  \n\nThere are no end of questions for the author, who it appears to me is the one whose mind is fooling him.",

        "I am 68 who is still open minded and more positive about the world.  My theory is people as they age have a much more negative view of the world as their body ages and has aches and pains.

Perhaps this also explains why people become more conservative as they age and are motivated more by fear than by love.",
        "Here in the UK Brexit illustrated the illusory siren call of a return to a supposed better yesterday. The reality is that all the problems, fears and insecurities which contributed towards the referendum vote in favor of leaving the European Union remain. Not only that, they\u2019ve increased as Brexit has undermined the economy and facilitated the entry into leadership of woefully unsuitable individuals such as Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. The tragedy is that all political parties remain in denial, fearful of upsetting those who effectively - if unwittingly - voted to destroy the country\u2019s future. The only positive to emerge is that we\u2019ve provided an example to other countries in the sense of indicating what happens when hubris, ignorance and pride are given free rein: there will be no Frexit, Italexit or Spexit any time soon.

However, I've seen terrible changes take place in this country since I was a child in the 90's, all the progress we've made has been rolled back by people who foster hate and peddle conspiracies. A positive attitude won't change the fact that my parents had low-paying jobs in the 80s but bought a home, I have a good job that pays well but can't afford to buy a house. Maybe things aren't as bad as they've been, but they're certainly worse than they've been in quite a long time.",
        "In my working years, I went through short periods of fear and worry but, in every instance, I worked out a way to take action. When I was taking action, I wasn't worried, I was too busy. When I retired I began to feel a dependence on the actions of others. My retirement income depended on the whims of the market and on the actions of the government. There was no longer any action I could take that had a direct influence on my fate. \n\nDuring my lifetime, I've seen a change in the way many others approach their problems. Instead of looking for ways to take direct action on things themselves, they began to believe that they should look for ways to make the government take action. Their idea of problem solving is to do something dependent on the whims of others. That's no way to live.",
        "What's disheartening is seeing all the anecdotal observations of these commenters with their obvious selection biases being put forward as arguments against these findings, particularly the risible claims of ignorance on the part of the study's authors. Complaints based on your policies of choice not being in effect (e.g., the level of the minimum wage being too high or too low, access to abortion being to lax or too restrictive, etc.) is not a valid scientific counterargument and is representative of nothing other than your individual dissatisfaction.",

        "Interesting theories which make sense on a general scale but I have to take exception to the somewhat facile view expressed by the authors regarding the perception versus the reality of the breakdown of morality. I think it depends on your definition of morality. For many, the decrease in adherence to religion and the increase in relationships outside of marriage, unwed mothers, abortions and divorces does, in fact, suggest a moral decline. While I personally do not not subscribe to this view in its entirety, anyone who does not acknowledge the significant numbers of Americans who ascribe to it and it\u2019s impact on politics in this country is fooling themselves.",
        "It's a subject that makes me crazy, because I think about it every day. I have asked my psychologist several times if I can really think about transforming my pessimism into optimism. He says yes, but I can't get out of that state of discomfort that, I think, is caused by my pessimism.\n\nIf we really are better than before... then why are we so pessimistic? Could it be that human beings project a future that is better than the present and the past, in a logical evolutive sense, which is generally not accessed? Maybe It has something, or a lot, to do with the fact that we live a life that \"forces\" us to have a lot of everything, that creates a constant demand for consumption, that means that nothing you have is good for a lifetime. \n\nSo the perception that we are worse than yesterday is a logical consequence of the \u201cmessages\u201d we receive every single day, and as real as the other aspects covered in this article.\n\nWhat we believe is as real as what we are. Believing is reallity.",

        "Regardless of what the opinions are of these professionals life in the USA and many other countries thought the world, is incorrect. My reasoning for why life is getting worse for most people, other than the wealthy, is that in my 63 years on this planet, I grew up in the \"middle class\" despite my parents not making a lot of money during their working lives. We had a 18 foot wide row house with 1-1/2 bathrooms and with three bedrooms. My parents owned two used cars, mostly used ones later in life. When I went to college the cost of CUNY semester was $40.00 a credit plus books. When my parents retired they sold our row house for NINE times what they paid for it in 1962 (with a 25 year mortgage at 5% interest). They retired at 64/63 and bought a two bedroom/two bath condo in West Palm Beach, FL for 1/3 what they sold our house for. Today my salary is now 1/2 of what I had made prior to 2019 at the same employer. I will be lucky to sell my condo for 3.5 times what I paid for it 29 years later and I do not have enough money to retire even though I made a high 5 and low 6 digit salary since the 1990's up to 2019 even with two 401Ks. I am single and had no children. My niece and nephew (a nurse, making $120,000) cannot afford my condo now selling for about $800,000! I paid $206,000 in 1994! Besides high cost of real estate, huge college costs, the new generations and myself will not live a life(style) that my parents did even though they lived through the Great Depression and WWII.",

But when I express my belief that \"things are worse today than they were at XYZ point in the past\" I'm talking about increased moral corruption, not necessarily at the level of the individual, but at the level of the institutions - media, government, education, healthcare, finance, and on and on - that are responsible for the maintenance and functioning of the material realities of quotidian existence. Yes, my neighbors are very friendly. And the people I interact with in my community on a day-to-day basis seem quite nice, for the most part. But, tragically, they can't raise the minimum wage, fix our profoundly broken congress, stop medical industry grift, or make corporations stop stealing from all of us while they stuff cash in the pockets of our elected representatives (and our judges!).

Despite the horrors, atrocities & inequities of that century, I still recall important differences. Like health care & coverage that wasn't driven by profit-making industry, especially Medicare, which is now a shameful, inadequate, expensive, maze-designed quagmire. I remember when teenagers couldn't access military weapons of mass destruction; when Democrats & Republicans, despite the ideological differences, still spoke to & worked relatively cooperatively; when young people knew something about life before they were born; when newspapers were abundant and social media didn't exist; when most people didn't go about with \"smart\" phones glued to their hands 24/7/365; when AI was science fiction instead of a very real fast-track to disaster; and when people and the planet weren't trying to kill each other - which we're now doing, quite efficiently.

People may actually tend to be *more* narcissistic these days when they are alone and are not in the presence of an experimenter, or other people.

Building on a clearly identified foundation, we can then more effectively explore the subsystems and more discrete systemic connections.\n\nStudies may seem interesting and support academic status, but they are not necessarily helping us to connect at the fundamental level of being human, which is truly the moral crisis we are increasingly threatened with, if we have eyes and ears to see.

But the dichotomy they give us is false. We do not have to choose between an absurd notion of morals declining continuously for millennia and this decline\u2019s being an illusion. It could just be that morals are situational. If situational, the assumption that they can be measured on an ordinal scale isn\u2019t needed anymore. And once the ordinal scale is gone, so is the decline. Frequent change in community standards for moral behavior then explains the perception: Older folks see a decline because they grew up under different standards, and the young see the same thing because they think the earlier standards unfair, and view the continued enforcement by their elders as a new, selfish arrogance on the loose in our world.\n\nTo show that morals are situational, we can ask whether citizens are obligated to report a sudden, rapidly growing fire. One answer that\u2019s been defended in mainstream media outlets lately is yes, if they\u2019re white, but not if they\u2019re Black, when first responders will, automatically and presumptively, suspect them of arson.

The replacement work vs. leisure created by the industrial revolution has been significant in my lifetime, but on the paleo-scale our species has achieved a remarkable standard of living with most of us now pursuing our dreams that are highly dependent on fossil energy, in a densely populated urban environment.\n\nThis dependency must change and the change can be disruptive to our sense of security.

        "So many people mythologize a Golden Age of the 1950s, when \"families could live on one income and jobs were easy to get.\"  I grew up in the 1950s. This was true only for *some* middle-class, white, heterosexual men. It was not true for working-class women, who worked all their lives at jobs considered appropriate for females, such as being store clerks, waitresses, or hair dressers.  These paid much less than those \"great union jobs,\" people refer to, which were for *some* working-class *men*.  Middle-class women were expected to marry and become housewives, the few careers open to them involving serving others.  They could be teachers, nurses, or secretaries. There was considerable prejudice against Black people.  Few people dared to be openly gay, because that made them standing targets for abuse.  And no, everyone did not get pensions.  Pensions were mostly for people who spent 30 solid years doing white-collar work for the government or for the same corporation, not people who did white-collar work for small businesses. In the 1980s, many corporations removed those promised pensions for workers who had already served most of their time, and were nearing retirement, and replaced the pensions with inadequate 401K contributions.

It's dangerous.\n\nAnd the media rarely report on the good--though sometimes it is newsworthy.  And good or bad varies per attitudes, anyway--- as we see in our constant political arguments. \n\nYes, the public has to be informed of horrific mass shootings, and daily violence, crime, exploitation, abuse, etc etc, in order to try to get solutions---and to hold their politicians accountable. \n\nThe last US president has for years poisoned our media, and our current daily news always shows his frightening face and statements. I scroll away.\nAre voters forewarned now of all the dangerous, hostile candidates--- who are just seeking power---who can actually be elected president of the US in 2024? Can we ever return to less exploitive candidates?\n\nYes, it's upsetting to watch the news as our politics gets more poisonous.",

The fact that they are not responsible or feel a weight of responsibility, again, in general contributes to a more optimistic view of the world. This optimism tends to decrease as we encounter more challenges in life, gain more life experience and understand the world a little better. We realize our unmitigated optimism needs to be reevaluated. As we grow older, with more and more issues we encounter and understand, our optimism shrinks further. Perhaps we did not start the fire, but as we mature we begin to feel more of the heat and the wellbeing of our progeny begins to cloud our optimism further.

        "Just a couple of points that jump out at me:\n\n1. Conflating what goes on the lab with what goes on in the world undermines any general assessment of the issue, which is far more complicated than Mr. Mastroianni acknowledges, although he certainly is aware of this. E.g., the fact that lab games show that people cooperate in this or that manner under this or that specific condition indicates next to nothing about cooperation in the real world, despite what many social psychologists claim.\n\n2. There's a difference between claiming that there was a \"golden age\" in the long past and from the claim that \"things\" have gotten worse over the years.  I can hold the latter with good reason without being committed to the former.\n\n3. If we understand by \"things are worse [at least here in the U.S.] now then they used to be\" something like the undermining of traditional moral norms associated with virtue, generosity, empathy, civility, then there's a pretty strong case for the soundness of the claim, regardless of the alleged evidence culled from surveys and lab experiments.\n\n4. Any overall conclusion drawn about the state of morality is  limited by the questions in the surveys.  On what basis is it claimed the questions collectively capture what it means to say that \"things are/are not better today than they were in the past\"?",

Child abuse, violence and discrimination on the basis of race, gender and sex\u2026 all of these problems and moral failings were worse in the past but covered in the media far more frequently now. No wonder everything now _seems_ worse than it was. \n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that Drs. Mastroianni and Gilbert deliberately or unconsciously avoid the issue of reporting bias, given Dr. Gilbert\u2019s history on the subject. Indeed, he is not alone - many of the more senior professors in his field still fail to acknowledge the corrosive effects of reporting bias on the reproducibility of research in their own discipline.

Many among us are beholden to conspiracy theories, including lawmakers. Cruelty masquerades as policy as immigrants are treated as subhuman--Trump separated children from families, and more recently, DeSantis resorted to kidnapping. Women face heart-rending choices as they have been stripped of bodily autonomy. Our democracy is on life support as many still support Trump despite inciting an insurrection at our capital, multiple indictments, and his constant stream of lies. And yet, Trump may still resume his assault on decency by winning the presidency again. Meanwhile, our climate threatens all life on our planet due to years of denial and inaction.

Middle class is certainly shrinking, as the concentration of wealth continues to flow upward to the oligarchy.  Affordable housing, education, opportunities continue to shrink because of wealth concentration.  Large Corporations of the 1950s, 60s and even in the 1970s  cared about and were stakeholders in their communities. They cared about infrastructures, schools, an the over all well being of the community. Not anymore, Large Corporations now only care about the company stockholders and nothing more. Large corporations are not even loyal to the United States.  Standard of living across the globe has risen, but that rise has been minuscule compared to the rise of wealth of the Oligarchy.  Instead of trickle down economics, we need streaming down economics.  When CEOs use to make 10 times the amount of the average worker they lived a fine life, now they make 300-400 times more at the workers expense.  Reaganomics has been a disaster the past 40 years and since that time our middle class has shrunk and the concentration of wealth expanded. So things are getting worse for the vast majority.

It probably reflects the same mechanisms that lead people to rate the changes in the economy as lower than that of their own economic situations.\n\nMy parents, a producer and writer in the entertainment industry, always said the first rule of drama is \"Where's the conflict?\" This applies not only to fiction but to non-fiction and journalism. The desire to get an audience leads to presenting conflict.\n\nIn general, then, our perception of our collective state is more fraught than our personal states because the information about it is generally more negative.\n\nIn addition, if we were as negative about friends, colleagues and family as we are about public figures, we would provoke reactions from friends, colleagues and family. This social pressure probably limits the negativity in personal spaces.\n\nThis has taken an interesting turn with social media, because it's easier to be a complete troll there than in face-to-face interactions.

        "I want to add that our morality has changed and this change has been brought on by the modern world.  We have gone from a deontological (duty to obey) morality to a consequentialist (ends justify the means) morality. \n\nIt was a much simpler and less complex deontological world until around 1850 as the industrial revolution gained traction.  People just followed the ten commandments or the golden rule to obtain the good housekeeping seal of approval from their peer groups. Outcomes involving material success were not that important.  The two world wars propelled us forward from the 1850s to the 1950s and modernity.  Suddenly we were thrown into a consequentialist moraliy.\n\nThe western form of capitalism puts most of the focus on rational self-interest and individualism, or as we have already termed it; consequentialism. In the US a patent-holder has a legal monopoly on a product for 17 years: a copyright-holder for 50 years.  This has produced a regulated marketplace.  People who believe the US has \"free markets\" are mistaken.  \n\nWith consequentialism, if you are a winner (despite any lying, cheating, and stealing), your outlook improves and you experience material success.  And if you are a loser (experiencing a lack of material success), you're doomed to either thinking yourself a failure (which is psychologically untenable) or you conclude that the system was rigged against you.

Recent articles cite several studies that show that a significant cohort of teens spend as much time on social media as many us do at our full time jobs.

It's just that they are relentlessly ground into our brains, while some \"inconvenient\" good news goes unremarked upon, like the fact that in my lifetime global famine has been greatly curtailed, there have been gigantic increases in the rates of education in places like Africa and Asia, there is far less pollution in the US than in the 1970s, there has been progress on rights for minorities, women, gays and transgenders that has transformed America since the 1970s and that is still ongoing, and so on.\n\nThe world is a better place for more humans than it has ever been before.

That was followed by the rest of the 60s and 70s -- but even in the worst days, the days of cities burning, my classmates coming home in body bags, assassinations that ripped our hearts -- we had hope of change and bettermet.\n\nAnd despite the major bumps in the road, Reagan and the intermittant rise of authoritarianism, we were changing.  We were ending major diseases that killed millions every year.  We were making social progress towards equality and equity.  We still had hope.\n\nNow, the Fascists are right in front of our faces.  It is 1934-35.  Laws are enacted to oppress and eliminated not only people's civil rights but their very lives.  You could, if you are atudent of history, call them the beginning of Nuremberg laws.  They are targeting visible minorities -- Black voting rights, trans people, queer people -- and people whose rights threaten the patriarchy: women.\n\nI'm a Jew.

        "Interesting. This article seems to make the case for optimism. I am neither an optimist or pessimist. I am a realist or better yet a fatalist. There was a study done on human survival rates during war time. They discovered that optimists & pessimists had the lowest survival rates and realists had the highest survival rates. Much of this was due to the fact that optimists can't function in times of absolute despair and when bad times come and are sustained, optimists break mentally and become suicidal. Pessimists fared no better. They become paralyzed by inaction and simply accept dire circumstances, believing them to be futile and there is nothing they can do about it. However, realists had extreme high survival rates because no matter how bad things got, realists passed no judgment on the situation and simply adapted and did what they needed to do to survive. \n\nTo that extent, I accepted long time ago that this world is a horrible place & human being are horrible creatures that would completely destroy the Earth if she let them. Climate change & all these natural disasters are simply Earth's immune system kicking into high gear to eradicate its disease called humans. I move thru he world accepting how horrible humanity is & how horrible they've made this world for most people, except the few at the top. This neither makes me happy or sad.

The images that are rewarded with constant  repetition are the ones that keep people glued to watching television and social media for hours per day. Today \" reality \" is owned by corporations that want to generate profits and determine the desires of the consuming . public.

Technology itself may make our physicial life easier but mental stress widespread. World is in greater turmoil and individualism with greed has become socially acceptable. Pleasure may have increased but simple happiness appears to be on a decline. Global warming and AI also increases our anxiety. Rich in India when I was young 70 yrs ago were never admired but now they are celebrated. We had great leaders like Nehru, Gandhi but now shallow religious nationalists are in charge.

Having a free press does not make the news pure, and never has. Most Americans get their news from a commercial source that needs to maintain the financial support of its consumers. Sometimes, as with supermarket tabloids, the news is largely false but even the mainstream press, like the Times, selects and presents its news in ways that maximize customer engagement. Local TV news dominated by an endless series of fires and accidents, national TV news is tornadoes, floods, and other disasters. Online news gets its leads from the traditional news outlets. So wherever people turn they are fed a diet of anxiety-inducing coverage that heightens their perceptions of danger and conflict. Researchers should recognize and account for this strong bias in the coverage and presentation of news that forms the opinions their surveys reveal.",

Then I remember when college was affordable, but woe unto the unwed mother or victim of rape, or gay people or people of color or immigrants, etc etc. it makes sense that belief in the Golden Age is a precursor to the conservative voter. It is the making of a fascist.\nIt would be interesting to divide \"people\" up into their groups and compare exactly who believes in a Golden Age and who doesn't and why.",
        "Oh no you don't! You can't blame our own brains for the anti-human ideologies of the extreme left and extreme right, both of whom are fanatical in their devotion to the idea that we are our own worst enemy. The right would have us believe in \"American Carnage\" while the left is convinced that we are a threat to the very planet, itself. But what else can you expect given the impact of Original Sin, which has been used for literally thousands of years to persuade us that we are unworthy of living without authoritarianism? Yes, the Enlightenment and the Age of Reason were mere blips in all that irrationality, but they were enough to give us the concept of individual rights and kickstart the Industrial Revolution. This was enough to begin the process whereby increasing economic freedom made it possible to lift ourselves up out of endemic poverty, leading to a revolution in living standards. This process began in the West and had to overcome many obstacles, including slavery, but by the end of the Twentieth Century it had swept over the entire world, making it possible for our planet to sustain 8 billion of us. But now both left and right expect us to give all of that up - and to blame ourselves for having to do so. It is their own ideologies that are to blame for their power-lust, not human nature. And it's time to tell them where they can put it.",
        "And who trumpets and magnifies these sinister forces?  The news media.  Merchants of fear and hate.  When people tell me how awful it is today I tell them to go look out the window.  What do you see?  A distinctively prosperous society operating in relative harmony.   Yes.. we have problems.  And yes they have the potential to spin out of control.  But just look around.  It's a wonderful life out there.. if you choose to make it so.  PS.. I was once a news reporter.  I quit because in my soul I knew life was far better than the way we were portraying it.",
        "Fantastic.  I have noted that commenters in the NYT sometimes tend toward the apocalyptic.  This helps me have compassion for them.",
        "In a time far away (well a number of decades back), think tanks working for the Koch brothers surmised that these facts can be used for political gain.  Take the fact that people can be convinced that the world is going to H in a handbasket and turn them on each other to get their greedy little sycophants into office.",
        "No, my brain didn't trick me when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. And it's not tricking me when half of the country would be happy to see him take office again. \n\nThings are legitimately worse.",
        "No, my brain hasn't tricked me into \"thinking everything is worse\"; it is that everything is endangered, and human-kind is locked into a path of no return, as corruption and greed rule.",
        "I love it when an expert purports to uncover the hidden ways in which the perceptions of millions of people have misjudged what the expert never defines. From the title, which refers to \"everything,\" to the middle, which narrows the scope to everyday measures of \"morality\" to the wholly undocumented assertion of \"biased memory\" which claims that \"negative information fades faster than positive information,\" to the conclusion which begins with the word \"if\" (not, as required in science and law, reasonable certainty), the author fails to support his non-conclusion, and worse, doesn't say what we should do about if it is correct.",
        "It's faulty logic to make the assumption that because people throughout the ages assume things have gotten worse is necessarily an \"illusion\" or a \"bug\" in thinking, and that actually everything is just fine. People in the past have been speaking of what they observe in their time, and most seem to feel it has gotten worse than what was before. There are also demonstrable, measured declines in the environment, worker precariousness, and social factors like marriage, crime, homelessness. The ability to acknowledge that is a \"feature,\" not a \"bug.\"",
        "Things are not worse in the America of today than in the America of the past, it's just that our brains trick us into thinking the past was better, and it's politically and economically harmful to try to resurrect some imaginary golden age of America of the past?\n\nI think things are worse today than ever before in America for one great reason: I think in the America of the past and in line with the entire development of Western Civilization thinking truth to large degree was sought and believed able to be handled by people, and that progress in society was measured to large degree by how much truth has been achieved and disseminated to people, but now especially with the advance of computers and apparently the study of the human brain (all sciences dealing with the human brain) you can say that what's sought over truth, or which is the truth most sought, is how to lie, con, perpetrate fraud, deceive better than ever before, that everybody from the conman on the street to the advertisers and propagandists to the intelligence communities finds it in their interest to know how to play all sorts of psychological games on people to manipulate them, misdirect them, redirect them, and keep them in their place. \n\nAlmost daily we hear statements along lines that our brains don't really work right and suffer all sorts of cognitive biases, etc. and one of the biases is that apparently we wrongly think things were better in the past and that we must be discouraged in this belief.",
        "One of the things that I always tell my friends is that \"in the olden days\", there were just as many atrocities committed as there are today, perhaps more. But we have access to so much more information today than in the past, we hear more about these atrocities than ever. And nice things don't often make the news, because they are viewed as normal aka not news. The world is filled with good people doing good things, and we should spend more of our time finding out about them and less time being outraged by the abhorrent behavior of the few.",
        "It\u2019s fascinating how many of these comments work so hard to disprove this scientists conclusions. Almost all are completely anecdotal, but stated with such fervor. In the end, supporting the authors conclusions. And proving we all really do knee jerk against science when it doesn\u2019t support our own assumptions of the world. I\u2019m an independent and find it fascinating to watch both conservatives and liberals fall into this trap - over and over again.",
        "We generally surround ourselves with people we know and agree with us.  This has never been a new phenomenon but with the rise of mass media it is more obvious.  Beyond our boundaries the world may seem threatening.  And this threat may be real or not.  Determining what is a threat and what is not seems dangerous in itself.\n\nI have acquaintances who see Donald Trump and the Republican extremists  as perfectly safe even as their movement takes away rights, sanction actions that threaten national security and democracy itself and see it as perfectly OK.  Meeting them they may seem kind  and foregigiving but scratch the surface and their beliefs at least to me are toxic.  There is a definite disconnect between reality and the beliefs that offer the threat.",
        "We have been told \"just say no to drugs\" and variations on that for decades.  The drug that causes the most deaths and social wreckage, alcohol, for reasons beyond me, is not called a drug. And is promted with billions of ad dollars.  People using safer drugs are jailed or fined.  It seems kind of backwards.",
        "That is a great photograph. Composition, etc yes, but so simple yet tells a powerful emotional story.",
        "Studies like this far too overemphasize a simplistic view of reality that just doesn\u2019t hold. You can\u2019t try and explain away as cognitive bias a creeping sense that something is wrong when we work more hours than ever before for less money as prices for everything continue to shoot up, technology rules our lives in a way unthinkable 20 years ago, more and more people are alienated from each other than ever before, mass gun murders are an every day occurrence, but no - it\u2019s a \u2018bug\u2019 in our brains. What does this do to solve the very real material challenges out society faces today, other than potentially blame the sufferer for simply not getting over their \u2018bug\u2019 and believing the lab researchers that everything is fine?",
        "It's cyclic.  It's not like the revolutions of the past happened without cause.  It's not like the world wars were fought due to cognitive miscalculation of the morality of others.\n\nHumans individually may be holding steady or improving in moral turpitude, but society as a whole suffers wild swings and at the moment, we are not in a good situation.\n\nRegarding our social circumstances, I would think it is more misappropriation of cause when people say the #1 issue for government is moral decline.  In fact, I think it is a ploy of the autocratic types to get people to make the misappropriation, then say \"I am the one who can make the needed changes.\"\n\nI agree it's a cognitive bug, but the problem is its weaponization, not its existence."
