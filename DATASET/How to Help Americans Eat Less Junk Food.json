For many (including people like me who have celiac disease), this isn\u2019t a part of \u201chaze of aggressive marketing,\u201d it\u2019s an important tool that helps us choose foods that are safe for us to consume.

This inclination to deny the existence of individual agency as if people are cells in some greater orgasm has become ridiculous. We evolved to rely upon overeating to survive but we can cultivate habits to keep from doing so. But it\u2019s a task which each person must choose to achieve.

        "\"Fat people food,\" is an apt descriptor I use. It works. Here's a list of \"Fat people food\": anything made in a bakery, birthday cakes, ice cream, anything wrapped in plastic, anything in a box or bag with a cartoon character, anything with more than 15g sugar, etc. It's so obvious. Fat people have distinct dietary habits and make clear choices in common. Whe nI made those same choices, I got fat. When I stoped making those choices, and made different ones, I got less fat. Simple huh? It works. \n\nWhat else? The crib sheets are on the grocery check out counter, put there by fat people- just look and learn. Soda, cookies, processed meats, candy, liquor (7 kcal/gram)... All you need to do is examine the physique and the grocery payload- no guessing necessary. It couldn't be more obvious.\n\nOffended? While a confused country, mostly overweight frets and kvetches about mere details this strategy WORKS.\n\nAs for warning labels & \"Nutrition facts\"... Such advice and theory of public information is weak sauce. I can't take seriously any recommendation that purports that MORE information will help as all of the info is literally out there... And you don't need anything but your EYES and brain (calibrated properly).",

It's poverty. Cooking good food takes money, access, time, and energy, and most Americans lack at least two of those things. Instead of wasting money on warning labels, the government should take the following steps:\n\n1. Raise the minimum wage. It should be at least $20 an hour, nationwide.\n2. Eliminate food deserts. No one should be getting their groceries at a gas station. Ensure every American has a grocery store within walking distance, or for rural areas that every town has at least one grocery store.\n3. Switch to a four-day work week, or lower the work week to 30 hours instead of 40. Provide incentives for companies to hire full-time workers, and punishments for those who don't.\n4. Free childcare for all. Free school lunches for every child. Summer meal plans for kids whose parents are struggling.\n5. Tax the rich. That's the only way to pay for all this.",

        "I have found the solution for much of what ails my fellow Americans and that is to abstain from processed foods. That means pasta, chips, bread, crackers, cookies, pies and cakes. I indulge in the occasional whole wheat tortilla to wrap around my scrambled eggs with salsa or chile garlic  spice. I also quit alcohol. The lessening of sugar intake from the alcohol made it easier to resist any craving for processed foods and sugary snacks. Is it easy? No. But I feel and look better eating whole grains like farro and lots of veggies and fruit which has have enabled me to drop 12lbs in two months. We are overwhelmed with ads to eat and consume. Every movie or tv show using booze as a prop, pushes the consumption of alcohol. Many act as if they are powerless to resist the siren call of the adman. We can and should, for our health, absolutely resist. Almost 50% of Americans are clinically obese. It is one of the reasons we had such a high mortality rate than other developed nations during Covid. Obesity is one of the physiological aspects each of us has the power to change. It is unfortunate that our government lacks the will to put a stop to the subsidization and promotion of food like substances which offer zero nutrition and pounds of misery.",
        "I think Azalea Lover is on the right track.

She worked outside the home, as did my dad, but they both made time to cook real food, from real ingredients. \nEducation & labeling are important, but so is prioritizing good health enough that we are willing to spend a little time shopping for & cooking real food.",
        "A warning label will only be as effective as it is accurate - with the science still seeming to shift on nutrition every few years, are we really at a place where we can authoritatively say what *is* healthy or not?\n\nEven sugared drinks, which seem like they should be the absolute easiest dietary culprit to warn against, aren't that simple - you push people from, say, Coke to Diet Coke on the basis of sugar alone, and before you know it they've exploded into morbid obesity from a digestive system that's become trained by the latter to constantly crave sweetness and to never feel satisfied.\n\nThe problem with simple labels is that nutrition is *complicated*.\n\n\n...Might be better to go after the source - for-profit foodstuff companies whose obligation is to their shareholders, not their customers, and as such are duty-bound to engineer their products to be overeaten.  In the financial sector, there's a concept known as a \"fiduciary\" - a money manager who's legally bound to act in the financial interest of their customer, rather than themselves or their company.\n\nIt's about time we likewise started treating our food companies as \"nutritiaries.\"",
        "Eat whole foods (meaning unprocessed, not purchased from whole foods market), preferably from plants. Avoid highly processed foods, instead use only lightly processed foods (frozen, canned, or with a few whole food ingredients) in meal preparations.\n\nThat way, it\u2019s not necessary to wade through nutrition labels or ingredient lists. And nutrition labels don\u2019t include important nutrients, such as fiber \u2014 found primarily in whole plant foods, as there is no fiber in animal products  and very little to none in processed foods \u2014 and anti-oxidants and other phytonutrients, again found primarily in whole plant foods.",
        "The entire range of rating foods is a mish mash that has escaped proper assessment. The phrase, highly processed, is almost meaningless.  As is the term 'junk food' \n\nHumans do well with almost any diet so long as they get about the right number of calories and the big 3 nutrients - and for some a daily multi-vitamin/mineral tablet. \n\nI've had grand kids, nieces, nephews, and those of friends successfully launched into life with the most horrible diets.  \n\nOptimal and ideal? No, but mostly OK - so it seems.",
        "Exactly what do we mean by \"highly processed\"? Many traditional foods and food ingredients\u2014bread, pasta, salted peanut butter, cheese, graham crackers, tortillas, canned beans, Thanksgiving turkeys, etc\u2014contain added fats/sugars/sodium. So do all \"healthy\" ready-to-eat foods, such as frozen burritos. White flour and polished rice are denatured\u2014should they get a warning label? We would do better to model and teach cooking with healthy whole foods in our schools, as in France and Japan. Hyper-regulation and heavy reliance on ever-changing nutrition science only serve to confuse consumers even more. Case-in-point: Remember when partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) were recommended over natural ones?",
        "Go for it! Just make the warnings specific-- some people don't need to restrict calories, others need to be extra careful about salt or sugar. And it would be nice to pass legislation giving all Americans a right to health.",
        "What the people need is protection from food snobs like this, the kind of people who like to dictate what others can do, and usually raise their cost of living by pushing them to eat more-expensive food. If not for these people, greens, cabbage, potatoes, onions, melons, would all still be inexpensive foods for the masses. They want to label everything as \"ultra-processed\" when all that really means is prepared and cooked. In moderation, these foods are not bad. But if they admitted that, they would not have a career. Leave people alone.",

        "Just came back from two months in Germany, and I can attest the the ABCDE labels on food in the grocery stores 100% affected what I bought.  For instance, if I had a choice of two or three entrees, I chose the one with the healthiest ranking.  And I found myself wishing we had the same thing here in the US.",
        "I grew up in the 1970s.  We had all of the same junk food that people villainize today, but obese children were rare.\nIt isn't about the food (which already has nutrition labels) and it isn't about genetics, it's about the choices that people are making.  \n\nNothing will change until we stop blaming obesity on external forces and place accountability where it belongs: on the individuals who are making bad food choices for themselves and their families. We could start by increasing health insurance rates or decreasing health insurance subsidies (e.g., Medicaid) for people who are overweight, and banning the use of food stamps to buy junk food.",
        "Kudos to the FDA for any efforts they make toward better food transparency. Too bad the GOP will block it, and the (partisan) Supreme Court will back them up.",
        "A big problem with most of the labeling schemes to alert people to healthful choices is considerable disagreement about what is healthy. A salient example is fat. Many of us now believe that sugar, not fat, is the primary cause of obesity and other health problems and that fat is actually an important nutrient\u2014particularly fat from 100% grass-fed cattle and sheep that get all their food from a diversity of pasture plants. \n\nIt's best to select a variety of whole or minimally processed foods: healthy animal products, nuts, vegetables, and fruit\u2014 all organic and with no added sugar. This approach is also best for the environment and a stable climate.",
        "There are a few issues here:\n\n1.  Is it really practical to try to force people to eat in a manner that is currently considered \u201chealthy\u201d?  (Remember how we thought fat was never to be eaten, and that artificial sweeteners were \u201csafe and healthy\u201d).  There is constant and contradictory change in dietary recommendations. And they do not take into account what people actually want to eat.  Nanny state?\n2.  Cost.  Like it or not, the cost of processed foods is generally lower than the cost of fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish and dairy.  The people who would probably benefit most from such fresh food often simply can\u2019t afford it. \n3. Food Deserts. These  do not only occur only in inner cities, but rural areas as well.  When people do not have access to grocery stores, and only have access to convenience stores, they don\u2019t have access to better quality food.  Driving 20-40 miles for a grocery store, or trying to manage iffy public transportation in the city makes it difficult if not impossible for some. \n\nWhich leads me to my conclusion- wouldn\u2019t it be better to create access to better quality foods at an affordable price than to spend money on labels that most people will not even bother to read?",
        "I like this idea very much, however, given the recent Supreme Court overruling the Chevron case, I would imagine that if the FDA were to attempt to introduce this type of labeling, they would immediately be hit with huge lawsuits by the food manufacturers.  \n\nSince the Supremes have decided that courts are better \u201cexperts\u201d than regulatory agencies packed with actual experts, and because the ultra conservative wing of the Republican Party has achieved their decades long goal of packing the federal bench with young and extremely conservative judges, I expect that labeling foods as described in this article will never, ever happen in the U.S.",
        "Nutritional labels list far fewer nutrients than are listed on supplements and are discussed in public articles about nutrition. When composing memos I learned that comprehensive messages are long and are set aside for reading when the recipients have time, and usually are never read. Labels end up featuring few important facts and never any explanations. \n\nI do believe that to know what are the best choices for optimal nutrition requires serious education not simple messages.",
        "In addition to looking at nutritional facts, one should also look at ingredients mentioned on the labels. Whatever labels are placed, most important is individuals have to pay attention to their own health and their children. Else, no labels could help. For example, cigarette smoking is hazardous to your health, still people are smoking. If we can eliminate eating junk food, we can reduce our health care expenses and live better quality life.",
        "The problem/solution is that WE ARE America. We are corporate America. We are the supreme court. Vote, talk, purchase or don't like you own this. Those of us who vaguely want things better or \"like Europe\" should work harder, take more action, run for office, make noise.",
        "I live in a European Union country where these labels are on most food. My elementary-school children came home from school last month having learned about the labels and eager to inspect all the food in the fridge for labels. In the grocery store they now put the chips they always try to sneak into the basket back (\"eeww, it's E!\") and reach for the \"A\" or \"B\" option instead. \nClear labels + early education can work.",
        "I'm a long time fan of Mark Bittman, and I appreciate the suggestion that more labels will make people eat less junk food. But I also think that what is happening in California is a better route: make it more expensive.  Gavin Newsom signed a law mandating fast food workers get paid $20 per hour.  What happened? Prices skyrocketed. Fast food joints are often empty; many have gone out of business.  This is a good thing--reminiscent of when cigarettes were taxed until their price-per-pack made people quit.  I'm eating less fast food because it is too pricey, anc cooking more at home. Does that solve the problem of chips in stores?  No. And labeling is better for that. But I think taxing bad food is a better route than a label, ultimately.",

It's what we see when we first enter a grocery or convenience store.  It's what I have to walk past to get to the self-service station where I pay for my groceries (cookies and crackers to the left, ice cream to the right).\n\nWe need a lot of will power to avoid the junk that is on offer.  Produce is an easy choice.  Milk products make for an easy choice, if not chocolate or strawberry.  Eggs make for an easy choice.  Frozen food?  I look for what has the fewest additives, has instead protein and fiber.\n\nIt's up to each of us to mount the battle.",
        "Our schools require students to study subjects that \"train their minds\" (theoretically) but have no direct application in most people's daily lives or occupations and may barely be thought of again, if ever, after graduation.\n\nI am thinking (prejudicially, I admit) of subjects like trigonometry, calculus, and even Algebra.\n\nIs the required class time for these subjects really more important than helping students develop life skills at as something as basic as eating in a way that does not undermine their health?\n\nWhat steers such priorities?",
        "I\u2019m not a fan of the nutrition-score rating mentioned here adopted by some European countries. While visiting my mom in Germany, I for example noticed a bag of dry-roasted salted macadamia nuts rated \u201cC,\u201d presumably either on account of the salt content or (an outdated view on) fat. If salt is an issue in someone\u2019s diet, it can be rubbed or rinsed off nuts, and any reasonable nutritionist ought to consider macadamia nuts that have only two ingredients (as opposed to be, say, covered in seasoning or chocolate) a healthy snack choice, not group them with junk food. So the South American system telling consumers what aspect of the food item is questionable or unhealthy makes much more sense.",
        "This is also a failure of our educational system as we do not teach nutrition and how what we eats affects the human body.We fail on so many levels to teach people how to live a healthy life and function in the world as we are overly concerned with who gets into Harvard.",

Not too many overweight people that I remember.\n\nWhen I had children in the 1980's, the snack offerings seemed to explode, Lunchables was a big thing in their middle school, and many mothers went out to work.  \n\nToday, with so many dual income homes, and mothers not making the food as often, or doing takeout or convenience foods, it seems to me there's a correlation there.  \n\nYears ago, a Weight Watchers leader said shopping the perimeter of the grocery store had the least amount of added fat and the biggest benefit to maintaining a thinner life.  I believe that still makes the most sense.",
        "I will never understand why people keep saying that cooking your own food is too much work. I hate spending money on food and I hate cooking, but I make 90% of my meals from scratch. My meals are often times overly simple and I make enough to last 2-3 days. I rarely spend more than 30 minutes cooking my 2-3 days worth of food. That means that between cooking and reheating I am spending about 3 hours a week on all my meals. There is nothing wrong with eating beans and rice with some cheese, sour cream, and salsa for several meals in a row. It is cheap and easy. A bag of dried pinto beans costs a couple dollars and you can freeze most of it depending on your family's size. People need to get over thinking that meals need to be something special. We should eat to live, not live to eat.",

Foreign workers have long been the backbone of the fresh produce, and have been making life-changing incomes from it even before the last decades growth in minimum wage for many states.  Now, with the higher minimum wages, even middle class workers can be enticed to make life-changing money through temporary H2A visas doing harvest work for, say, 6 to 10 weeks a year.  And still, no change in the number of domestic applicants.\nI have nothing against minimum wages going up, and would be glad to see it on a national level.  What is different here is the DOL imposes a punative AEWR--adverse effect wage rate--on top of the already high min. wage to ostensibly 'protect' the domestic workforce from foreign labor taking jobs that we have proven they do not want (in fact, if you can't prove it, your visa application will be denied).\nIn NY, the AEWR is $17.80, much higher than NYC's minimum, not to mention great money in Mexico.  The main produce growing states have seen their wage costs rise 60% in five years.  This is by no means a sustainable rate, and is pushing supermarket prices up, and growers out of business.  \nAnd when a farm goes out of business, no more guest-workers!

        "If you want Americans to stop making bad and self-destructive choices, you have to make the choice pretty simple. Just look at the upcoming election: A is good, B is bad, is not even simple enough.",
        "I arrived in America forty years ago, as a newlywed. I moved to the US from Austria, Europe.\nI was shocked by the portion size here. A small drink here had been a large one where I came from. The first \"All-You-Can-Eat\" sign made me laugh until I learned it was a serious invitation to overeat.\nFast food places on every corner. So much fried food, no salads, no healthy alternatives, just greasy, cheap food without nutrition. Salad dressings? I didn't know they came in bottles. There was something else than vinegar and oil?  \nQuickly I adjusted, perhaps too quickly, and years later, when I got some health issues, I remembered my roots and changed my lifestyle back to 'normal'.",
        "I like this suggestion - but - there\u2019s one fundamental flaw:  if it needs a label at all, it\u2019s probably unhealthy.  \n\nAre you going to stick an \u2018A\u2019 label one every solitary yam in the pile?",
        "I love these suggestions, however, the problem in the US is that our government and courts don't seem to be on our side, that is, on the side of ordinary people. Anything aimed at improving the health, nutrition or knowledge of Americans gets labeled as \"socialism,\" \"nanny state,\" \"elitism,\" or \"anti-business.\" The prevailing ethos seems to be caveat emptor. For example thanks to a heavily lobbied former Senator from Utah, vitamins and supplements don't actually have to contain anything that the label says it contains. And we're moving in the wrong direction with the Supreme Court rulings this week. It's almost as if the powers that be (mostly republicans), want us  to be as sick and ignorant as possible -- easier to manipulate.",
        "Part of the problem must be the general confusion between nutrition and diet. Yes indeed any one item can be bad for you, yet maintaining a consistently balanced diet or at least restoring it when it is occasionally ignored acts to mitigate temporary excesses.",
        "Unfortunately many people do not care about the labels.   Smoking was stopped only to a small extent by the message posted on cigarette packs and a good many may not attend even to large black pentagons, bright red circles or even chrome yellow spiculated shapes with warnings on them.\nFat has the capacity, as does salt and sugar to give a sensation of taste.   It is possible to use artificial flavors, but often that is not any better an option.\nHaving fresh fruit or other snacks may still be high in sugar and calories, but at least most are low in fat (excluding coconuts!).   The need to have people snack less or more healthily will probably continue to elude our best efforts.",
        "Hey, before you all jump on the \"potato chips cause heart disease \" train I want to remind you that coronary heart disease is a disease, not a lifestyle choice.  Plenty of young, fit men and women have fallen off their bikes with a heart attack and many of us have lived through that day due to the wonderful  advances in surgery.  I'm one of them.  After my stent was placed my cardiologist told me that I had done everything right, that if they had been able to look at my heart when I was a teenager they could have predicted the disease.  Yes we should eat well and exercise daily and reduce the stress in our lives but please remember that all the wheat germ, tofu, lentil soup and leafy greens in the world will not cure a disease.",
        "IMO these labels are nothing more than a sticking plaster. They bolster a veneer of acceptability regardless of what they are intended to do. I think most ppl will simply ignore them. \n\nThe focus needs to be on education including free basic cooking classes with free REAL ingredients which attendees can take home at the end of the class. No, I don't know who will provide the classes and the ingredients, but this is where effort should go, not on yet more labelling.",
        "I abandoned almost all foods with ingredients. It wasn't hard to do. Yesterday: Baked salmon, almonds, raisins, dark chocolate, apple, dried apricots, oatmeal, frozen blueberries, kale salad (bagged, whatever works), sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, fresh garlic, avocado, hummus, plain peanut butter, healthiest bread I can find, fresh strawberries and raspberries, air-popped popcorn with olive oil and salt, quinoa, a bit of non-industrial cheese (Asiago yum), coffee.",
        "I applaud the efforts of countries that provide clear information to consumers about the dangers of what they are ingesting. How powerful is the food lobby in the U.S.? I can\u2019t even imagine what power they wield with our donation- hungry legislators.\n\nWhat constitutes junk food? Take a walk down the cereal aisle. It is a complete joke. There may as well be bags of sugar on the shelves to be poured directly into children\u2019s cereal bowls. Froot Loops is 41% sugar. There should be blinking danger lights attached to every single cereal box overloaded with sugar. \n\nMy heart goes out to busy working parents who just want to put a meal on the table for their family. Unfortunately, processed foods can be prepared quickly, and they are less expensive than fresh fruits and vegetables. Two very small bunches of fresh broccoli cost $8.00 and that is just a side dish. \n\nThere is something very wrong with our food system and the rampant obesity in this country is a symptom of a sick system. \n\nPeople would make nutritious foods if it was cost effective and easy to prepare. Most people do want what\u2019s best for their families.",
        "The ideas shared here are all very good, and clearly have had positive effects in the countries that enacted this labeling.\n\nI'm concerned that here in the US, corporate lobbiests will bend over backwards to prevent such labeling.

Until the govt dietary guidelines aren't formulated by a committee poisoned on cherry-picked data (e.g., see 'The Seven Countries Study' by Ancel Keys that claimed eating saturated fat from animals causs heart disease (it doesn't)) or by having representatives from Industrial Food twist the guidelines for maximum profitability instead of human health, no additional labeling will be effective. Get the nutrition science correct first before having the govt label things. Unfortunately, in the US, we are more interested in people generating profit for industrial food companies than we are in actually telling people what healthy food is.",

I grew up in the 60's and have watched as marketing commercials and literally,  television jingles normalized it.   \"We are ADM\" back in the 1980's.   \nIt's interesting how smaller, so called secularized countries like Mexico can take on the fight,  yet we remain victimizing our poor.  And if you are older you really see it.  I did over decades in Los Angeles.   It was a different diet in 1970...",

        "We are what we eat.\n\nThe FDA is the agency designated by the Congress that regulates the food and drug industry. The regulations cover the production, handling and sales of processed and packaged food. Hygienic safety and ingredient purity is more important to FDA than the nutrition value or the harm the high sugar, salt or fat content causes to children and adults.\n\nThe FDA should pay more attention to the effects the food item causes just like they evaluate any drug, their benefits and side effects. The SCOTUS wants to dismantle the rule making and interpretation of law by the Administrative agencies. So, now, more responsibility falls on the Congress. In light of the obesity epidemic which starts during childhood, it\u2019s time the Congress tightens regulation on processed food and other nutraceuticals based on the nutritional value and the harm it can cause. \n\nWe cannot let the big corporations decide what we should eat.\nA voluntary ban on advertisements on TV and social media for junk food and sugary sodas and drinks by the Food industry could be a starter. For every best seller junk food item that a Corporation manufactures they should be mandated to provide a similar nutritious item low in calories, sugar, fat and salt.\nAnd, that item has to be displayed by grocery stores as an alternative on the same shelf just by the side of the best selling item.\n\nParents are responsible for the food they bring home for the children to consume. And, should insist schools do the same.",
        "These are great ideas to reduce the amount of junk food people consume!  I hope the US will adopt something close to this front-of-the-package labeling. It always surprises me that our country insists on doing things the \u201cAmerican Way\u201d, when other countries often have greatly effective ways of improving people\u2019s lives, and we could benefit a lot by adopting them.",
        "I don't even know what is being taught in HS health class, or if there even are health classes anymore. We used to learn about the food pyramid at least, and didn't have anywhere near the processed options we have today.\n\nAbsent more forceful labeling, it will fall on the parents to instill good eating habits. However they are battling huge headwinds - food deserts in many neighborhoods, pervasive and misleading food industry marketing, single working parents with limited time and money.",
        "Most people who are working full time and raising families have very little time to prepare meals. Single parents and two-earner families don't have the luxury of cooking from scratch because it is so time consuming. (I know I will hear from those who are able, but for many,  it is unrealistic goal. I personally did not want to spend my weekends cooking and freezing food.) Opening a canned or packaged product and heating it up for dinner is much more convenient and saves a lot of time. I know this from experience. When I was working, we ordered pizza once a week, heated up the frozen chicken fingers and even the canned Dinty Moore stew. Now that I am retired, I have more time to shop and cook healthy meals...and fewer to cook for.",
        "I was at the grocery store the other day. There was a woman in front of me who paid using her SNAP card and cash. Her daughter, who appeared to be about two years old, sat in the cart drinking a soda, which mom had to briefly take from her so the cashier could scan. Then the girl reached for a Twix, which mom also had the cashier scan and then handed it back to her daughter. \n\nIt was sad. No two year old should be eating a Twix and drinking soda. How does this happen? Is it lack of education? Is it being so overwhelmed with life that one can\u2019t procure nourishing food for one\u2019s children? Is it laziness or permissive parenting?\n\nI\u2019m an early childhood teacher and I can tell you with certainty that children who consume large amounts of junk food do not perform well in school academically, socially, or behaviorally.\n\nI\u2019m generally against the government interfering in peoples\u2019 lives but in that moment I thought to myself that it should be illegal to feed a young child that sort of food.",
        "While well-meaning, will larger labels really make a difference? Packaging is already very \"noisy\" - bright and attractive.  I think few will pay attention - those that might are likely already inclined to read the smaller nutritional label already present - and those populations at highest risk (and where health disparities are largest) IMO will not benefit.\n\nI wonder if those studies that suggest a benefit are 'real world\" studies?  Most studies are done in a room, under carefully-controlled conditions, with some survey questions following the different exposures.  Show me a study of sample packaging in a real supermarket, and video of what shoppers do.",
        "The grocery floor area taken up by junk is enormous, so it must be very profitable to the stores as well as the manufacturers. The actual cost to the world needs to be paid in some way--the cost of all the processing, which requires energy, the cost of all the packaging, the cost for producing the ingredients ( corn syrup, etc), which are, in processed foods, largely products of the giant agribusiness sector, highly subsidized by the USDA, e.g. taxpayers. That should end .   And there should be some sort of tax to help fund medical and dental care, on everything that is simply junk. \n\nLet's also stop training kids to eat processed foods in schools.  Many school kitchens only have giant warming ovens, but surely companies could prepare items that are less processed for that market .\n\nLike everything else that works better in other countries, we should look for ideas that have already been tested.  What does Europe do, for example, at every step of the  process for different kinds of foods? There is junk food available in stores there, but it doesn't occupy half or more of the floorspace.",

I was walking through the aisles of my local grocery store a few days ago.  Almost everything on the shelves was processed garbage. The produce section features fruit from Driscoll's which owns one-third of the U.S. berry market, Basket and Bushel, owned by Topco and then a lot of stuff from Dole and similar.  I am grateful that I live in a place where there are local small farms where I can go to get fresh produce from May-October, but it is even more expensive than what I can find in the grocery store.",

        "Current labels aren't doing much of anything.  Adding additional labels to processed junk food isn't going to do much in the long run either.\n\nWe have to get back to basics, to stressing whole foods again.  If the food you're eating doesn't look like the plant it came from or the animal it came from, it's not food.  It's junk.  Period.  Everything else is a just a distraction and an excuse to continue to feed a powerful food industry.  In the end, if American's simple switch to less processed more whole foods, the food industry will have no choice but to give people what it is they want...theoretically.",

        "Probably a good idea to introduce these packaging labels. I doubt this will make a substantial difference in our obesity epidemic, though, as people have already rationalized their bad eating habits while becoming addicted to fast/convenience food. \nI see this manifested in the few number of gardens (very cheap fruits and veggies) compared to 50 years ago, and reflected in the huge increase in obesity over those same 50 years. \nThe fast/convenience food companies have pandered quite well to human tastes for fats, sugars, and salts (we evolved to crave these, as we never knew where our next meal would come from). Now we reap what we sow.",
        "Heart disease, and many cancers, are--in the words of a couple of cardiologists I know--lifestyle diseases.  And bad eating habits are helping to make Americans fatter and sicker.  Covid demonstrated that overweight and diabetic people are often targets of opportunity for a virus.  And what you eat affects your gut bacteria and the chemicals they feed back into you.  And they also affect inflammation that can cause or exacerbate various issues.  But overcoming this trend means not only education at an early age, tough regulation of the food industry, but also a changing of tastes.  Sweet, salty and fatty are now considered desirable by too many \"cooking experts\" as well as eaters.  Convenience is king.  We will need to shift people to appreciating freshness, quality, and diversity.  It will not be easy, but we can be healthier.",

We\u2019re traveling in Japan this summer and while there\u2019s junk food around I don\u2019t see the Japanese buying much of it.\n\nInstead, there are tons of groceries and small local restaurants around with tons of unprocessed foods.

People in the US need access to healthy foods in all neighborhoods, not just the more economically affluent areas. Equally important, we need healthy food to be as affordable as the ultra-processed products that are cheaper and more plentiful. These ultra-processed items are not so much food as food-adjacent edible substances.  If we make real food affordable and accessible, then we can begin to manage the health crises directly tied to people's diets.",
        "It's stomach turning how highly processed \"foods\" are still considered \"foods\". Over the years, I've gotten better at reading labels and leaving highly processed foods on the shelf, but some still get through because they're ubiquitous and sometimes you want prepared foods that you don't have to cook from scratch yourself...

I haven't done the analysis, but I'm certain that Big Food's margins and the amount of real nutrition in any given product are in inverse proportion. Even unhealthy foods like sliced American cheese and ice cream are getting hard to find\u2014instead, we have two thousand options for \"cheese food\" and \"frozen desserts.\" Unlike the EU, which works to make life better for people rather than companies, the US has no political will to promote human health. Just look at our so-called medical economics.",

        "We have a country with a massive food crisis: due to extreme wealth inequality, millions of Americans live in food deserts, where labeling will not help. In a dollar store or a convenience store, the only possible non-ultraprocessed food may be a few dairy products and some rancid nuts- I have walked through some of these places to see how bad things really are. So, much as the labeling improves the information available, you have to have healthy alternatives available. Maybe tax the true junk food so these low quality stores are forced by price concerns to stock other items?",

When I look at people baskets in typical supermarkets, have their baskets are filled pre-packets sweets, treats, and cereal.",
        "I believe this will be as effective as putting calories on menus. We need to have food cost what it actually costs to society. We actually subsidize large corporate farms. Make portions smaller. Why can\u2019t I buy a small anything but I can buy extra large everything? Use taxes on junk food to pay for healthcare and real food in school lunches plus money for playgrounds and parks. Subsidize healthier food choices. And it doesn\u2019t have to be farmers markets, it can be frozen vegetables and fruits."
