        "Instead of allowing sales, institute a kidney donation lottery. \n\nVolunteers sign up and provide their blood sample. Then through random draws, donors are selected as need arises. The payment if you are chosen to donate should be a good value against dialysis, but large enough to attract affluent donors - maybe $100-200k. Of course, if you are selected, you are not obligated to go through with donation. \n\nThis mitigates the chance of exploitation since 1) no one knows when/if they'll be called up, and 2) the pay out is enough to attract non-desperate donors.",

        "There are very good reasons why society does not allow the buying and selling of body parts from the living, not the least of which are that anyone in possession of an asset with an active market is prone to larceny, fraud, and exploitation. And we haven't even gotten to run of the mill economic desperation. It doesn't matter who runs or regulates the market. \n\nMarkets create problems as well as solve them. The trade off is usually worth it, but there are clearly exceptions. Part of our political divide is between people who want to restrain markets in particular instances where the problems seem to outweigh the benefits and people who believe markets are the answer to everything and restraining them is always bad. \n\nDo you really want to have that argument with the body parts of living human beings?",
        "No, no, no! This opinion is Exhibit \"A\" for why people who have benefited from a kidney donation should not be making the policy about kidney donations. It is too easy to be blinded by all the good that the donation (from one's father, no less) has done for you, one individual with kidney disease. Absolutely, people would sell kidneys out of desperation for money. One only has to look at places where this has actually happened. (Google the Aljazeera article about \"Inside the world\u2019s biggest organ market\".) \n\nAnd this idea that people with 2 kidneys are walking around with an extra kidney! That is head-smackingly misinformed and/or naive. A little-discussed risk of donation is the fact that there is a non-negligible increase in the risk of the donor developing ESRD (kidney failure). \"In the model-based lifetime projections, the risk of ESRD was highest among persons in the youngest age group, particularly among young blacks. The 15-year observed risks after donation among kidney donors in the United States were 3.5 to 5.3 times as high as the projected risks in the absence of donation.\" Article source: DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1510491 And who does the author think will be the best match to donate a kidney for a Black person? Yeah, sure they will be at the \"top of the list\" for a kidney if they develop kidney failure. That will be cold comfort while they are on dialysis hoping a donor who is a good match will come along.",

It is as morally repugnant to attach a dollar amount to these risks, as if the human body is a giant organ farm and organs can be harvested without significant potential consequences. Of course, if the donor is deceased there is no risk, but in all other cases the risk is present, should be stated and should be taken seriously.\n\nRisk of Long-term Damage\n\n1. Increased Risk of Proteinuria: Some studies suggest that individuals with a single kidney may have an increased risk of developing proteinuria (the presence of excess proteins in the urine), which can be a sign of kidney stress or damage.\n\n2. Potential for Reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Over time, the increased workload may lead to a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, especially as the individual ages or if other health conditions that affect the kidneys develop.\n\n3. Hypertension Risk: There's an increased risk of developing hypertension (high blood pressure) in individuals with one kidney, which can further strain kidney function over time.",

        "While I agree with the concept, I agree with others that the system will be gained by the rich.  Laws already tilt to the wealthy.  However, to think that the ultra rich haven\u2019t already created a black market for organs would be foolish.  \n\nPeople already donate blood for money.  The company that draws the blood, tests it, and stores it then turns around and sells (I assume for a substantial profit) the blood to hospitals which charges patients $15,000/nt for one night at the hospital.",

        "I am surprised and disappointed that Mr. Walsh didn't mention the possibility of tissue rejection and the fact that transplantees would have to be on anti-rejection medication for the rest of their lives. I know whereof I speak. Three weeks ago I lost my beloved sister-in-law to kidney failure brought on by diabetes. She paid some lip-service to asking family and friends to test for kidney donation, but never did because of the possibility of her body rejecting the donor kidney and then she would have felt guilty for having asked. She was also very reluctant to go on the anti-rejection drugs. This is an issue that needs to be considered.",
        "Living Kidney Donor here. I completely support compensating donors. \n\nTo the many people in comments arguing against compensating kidney donors: I agree with your hesitations, we must be careful to structure any program to ensure that the disadvantaged are not exploited. Making sure that donors are able to consent, and delaying the compensation are two steps in the right directions. \n\nI would urge those opposed to consider the reality we live in today: 90,000+ people are currently waiting list for a kidney. Most are on dialysis, a 3 times a week medical procedure that saps your energy. Many of those people will die while on dialysis before they ever receive a kidney. This is not an acceptable outcome. \n\nI wish we lived in a world in which there were enough people willing to give their kidney altruistically that we didn't need to compensate donors. But we don't.\n\nIn other situations, we don't blink twice to pay people to risk their lives to save others (or just to make money). We admire and honor soldiers, firefighters, paramedics, etc. Is donating a kidney so different?\n\nSo we face a choice: live in a world where thousands of people die miserable and preventable deaths every year, or save lives (including many from the very disadvantaged communities we are concerned about) but risk the potential exacerbating inequities.",
        "well i have only been advocating this for years. i am not an organ donor because of the restrictions on compensating the estates of deceased donors. i dont see how it is more moral to force someone to undergo a very dangerous operation to donate a kidney or part of a liver or lung than to pay the estates of deceased donors a modest honorarium. this might not alleviate the shortage of donated organs but it is certainly worth a try.",
        "I was a non-directed donor 3 mo ago and echo a lot of concerns already stated. My bills were all covered as were my lost wages, caregiver's lodging and food, our transportation and childcare costs during surgery and recovery. I also am top priority if I need a kidney and have a 'voucher' for one where I listed up to 5 people who could be eligible.\u00a0Recovery is not always quick and people can have health impacts for life. I am in great health and had a couple \"minor\" complications - I was in incredible pain for days (and I've got a considerable pain tolerance) and had to stay longer than expected. I'm still not at 100% of my previous fitness level.\u00a0Specifically for race and class disparities, this proposal is unsettling. African American people have higher likelihood of kidney issues, and then they just have 1 later? Sure, informed consent about risks, but when you and your kids need that $$...$10k a year is A LOT to many folks. While donors will go to the top of the transplant list, but it's no fun getting there.Also, who is footing the bill for all of the prelim testing? It's expensive and time consuming.We may also risk the donor pool with people lying about their medical history.\u00a0I think we should continue research with animal organs (they don't have to be killed after surgery necessarily) over paying people, and I'm a vegetarian!",
        "How is this different from donating eggs?",
        "I am sorry, but if you can't see why incentivizing people with monetary gain to give up organs is a HORRIBLE idea, I honestly don't know what to say... It may 'save lives' but it will definitely take MANY more lives than it saves due to surgery complications\\malpractice and will create an entire organ black market where desperate people disappear after falling for promises of riches for their pound of flesh. How many otherwise perfectly healthy people would die on the operating table chasing the promise of a $10k payday? Or less, because let's be honest, as the supply outstrips the demand the per pound value of a human kidney would go into free fall... I can't believe I have to spell that out to a supposed \"intellectual\"... and that isn't even accounting for the fact that you are talking about letting rich people literally take the organs of poor people for profit... I mean it isn't like the standard Joe or Jane could afford a $10k or more payout to get off dialysis, and even if they could some rich octogenarian would simply out bid them. The rich would literally be harvesting poor people for organs.\n\nThe very idea of what amounts to a human meat market is so completely unethical and dystopian I can't even describe it wholly.",
        "I couldn't agree more with the thesis of the article.  The time is ripe for change, and paying for an organ seems the right path to follow.",
        "I have a dear friend, a \u201csister from another mother \u201c, who needs a kidney and i have offered to donate mine to her.  If that does not work out, i am considering offering my kidney to another person,  \n\nI am 63, in good health and financially well off.   \n\nThis article made me think about many things.  We often think about organ donations as personal decision.  How do we change that? How do we think of it as a public good?\n\nPerhaps  medicare could decide, for someone who has offered a kidney at  60 years of age some incentive like a reduction in medicare premiums? What that make possible in our society?",
        "\"Aha!\" I thought. \"Finally, Swift's satirical gem has been polished for the times.\" Very disappointed, but in a culture where we can seriously propose trading kidneys for tax credits or cash, I guess no satire could be more outrageous than the truth.",
        "Absolutely not. Opening the door to purchase of kidneys could expose migrants and the poor to pressure to sell pieces of their bodies.  Criminals might even kidnap people to steal and sell their body parts. I can't imagine anything more repellent or more likely to generate crimes and unethical practices. No, no, no.\n\nI have every sympathy for people who are suffering and waiting for a donor match. But buying kidneys - or other body parts - is not the right solution.",
        "I gave one of my kidneys to a stranger, but: If we pay firefighters and military service members to engage in risky actions to save lives, then certainly we can compensate kidney donors. Let's save lives together!",
        "I am a public health doctor and a bioethicist. \n\nWhat needs to happen here is what happens in some other countries around the world: presumed consent.\n\nNo paperwork required. You are presumed to be an organ donor unless you specifically opt out. This would go a long way (but likely not all the way) in meeting the demand for organs. \n\nFor that, we need to implement the public health preventative measures that other commenters have noted.",
        "I find this all very fascinating. \n\nThe idea of donor compensation is so strongly rejected by so many here, while it\u2019s perfectly ethical for us, as a society of spectators, to pay professional athletes in contact sports to sacrifice their brains and other body parts, so we can be entertained.\n\nHow to reconcile the fact that if one makes a career of sacrificing one\u2019s body for money\u2014through contact sports or any other financially-rewarding risky endeavour\u2014that\u2019s fine, but the topic of compensation for a life-sustaining kidney brings out the ethicist in everyone.",
        "Friend of mine is waiting for kidney, but doesn\u2019t need dialysis yet. Any means to get one would be appreciated. I think you should be allowed to sell one. The hospital and doctors aren\u2019t doing a transplant for free.",
        "Have you read _Banking on the Body_? The book addresses how the metaphor of \u201cbanking\u201d has impacted how society perceives and responds to donations of blood, milk, semen (and organs, too). There are unintended consequences to having this deeply cultural metaphor. That doesn\u2019t mean paying for organs would do only harm, just that the cost-benefit analysis isn\u2019t straightforward. In an environment where greed is ascendant, the result might cause more harm than healing. I\u2019m open to a nuanced discussion in a news story that examines many points of view\u2026 an opinion from one person isn\u2019t sufficient evidence to draw any conclusions other than: grateful a Dad could help his kid, and grateful a stranger could help that kid\u2019s brother\u2026 can you imagine only having one kidney to give but having two kids who need it? Love that the author and his brother were so fortunate, and so wish it could really be true for all. A kidney is a rare and precious resource. Thank you.",
        "7 mo ago I received a kidney from a living donor. I was lucky for only having been on home peritoneal dialysis for 6 months. \nMy donor was a person in Dallas. In return my daughter gave her kidney to a person in Dallas (we were not compatible for her\u2019s to go to me. Needless to say my life has changed dramatically. Her\u2019s was really only disrupted during her 6 week recovery. She could have gotten by with 2 with 2 weeks. My donor and the Dallas recipient were not related. Work mates and friends. \nI relay all this information hoping some others will look into becoming donors. The costs for the donor are picked up and the feeling of joy giving someone a new lease on life is innumerable.",
        "I find it crazy how several proposals in this article were tax credits rather than actually selling the kidney to someone, but everyone responding is yelling I WON'T SELL MY KIDNEY TO A RICH MAN! ONLY THE RICH WOULD GET TRANSPLANTS THEN!\n\nThere are plenty of issues this concept could cause, but all of y'all arguing about the scary kidney free market clearly only read the title of the article, because you're not addressing the more useful idea here, just the one that scares you.",
        "I would do it. So what if it's slanted toward people who need money. What's wrong with that? News flash: JOBS are also slanted toward people who need money.",
        "Aside from the moral issues in the article, there is a non-zero but small risk that the donor will be harmed by loss of the kidney.  The donor could develop circumstances later in life that would cause them to be on dialysis.  The donor could die from the harvesting operation.  Can a doctor really, ethically obtain truly informed consent to such a major procedure as a harvest (even with smaller incisions and minimally-invasive technique, it is still major), when there is major money on the table for the donor?  There is also a diversity and prejudice issues embedded in this:  If the recipient is wealthy and the donor poor, is that acceptable?  Should Black or Asian or Hispanic people be allowed to donate to a white recipient?  Would it ever be acceptable to pay a Native American person to donate if the recipient were not Native?  There are so many issues and abuses that confront physicians these days, and adding organs-for-cash is just adding more that can go wrong.",
        "I was a voluntary, non-directed kidney donor last year. My boyfriend donated his kidney 3 week ago to a stranger. We both had to go through extensive physical tests to make sure we were healthy enough to donate, as well as a psychological evaluation and multiple meetings with social workers. Itx I was assured I was able to back out of the process at any time, for any reason. I never once felt pressured to go through with the donation - but I am so glad I did. \n\nDonating my kidney was the greatest gift I could have given. I feel grateful every day that I was healthy enough to donate, and that my recipient is alive and healthy now. My recipient was incompatible with 99.6% of people - without me, they almost certainly would have died. My boyfriend kicked off a chain of 3 donations - 3 lives saved, because of his gift. This is not to bring praise upon us, but to share that because we were able to donate something we had extra of and will live full, healthy lives without, people regained control of their lives and will be able to live an untold number of years they wouldn't have otherwise had. That is a beautiful thing, in my opinion. \n\nI fully support compensating donors, and I fully support the End Kidney Deaths Act. I dream of living in a world where nobody dies needlessly because they can't access something we as a society have in abundance.",
        "No. Just no. I am a kidney donor. I prolonged my uncle's life by twelve years (he died of something else), and suffer only minor health effects because of it. I would do it again in a heartbeat. It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my life, and I would encourage every healthy American to consider it.\n\nBut this is major surgery. Mine went exactly to plan and yet I was quite sick for the first few days in the hospital and didn't regain full strength for a few weeks. And what if it doesn't go perfectly? A donor could die on the table or suffer irreversible health problems.\n\nThis would be a poor person's program. It just would. Poor and homeless people would sell their organs for the benefit of wealthy and middle-class people. You can set it up any way you like and that's what will happen. And that population will be older, less healthy, and less able to bounce back from even a flawless surgery. \n\nJust no.",
        "This idea is already being done in India - impoverished farmers hoping to get funds for they next years crop will sell a kidney and then find out it disables them from working their land.  They don\u2019t have tractors and rely on oxen to pull the plows like 18th century US.  So they get a bit of money but lose their livelihood nevertheless.",
        "The current legal framework, notably the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), prohibits the sale of organs. NOTA specifically states \"it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.\" The penalty of breaking this law is a fine of $50,000 or up to five years in prison, or both.",
        "One day we will grow kidneys. Until that happens, we just got to be grateful that altruisitic organ donations are even possible because for millions of years of human history they werent. Billions have died through history with only mercury creams and leeches to help them. So be happy with what you got. I dont want the Kidney Shark to come get me because I put my kidney up as collateral on a high interest loan.",
        "I donated a kidney. People are dying for no reason other than misguided imaginary morale objections. Have you ever seen anyone die after waiting for years on dialysis, I have. In the hospital there were two full surgical teams, they were all being paid. Everyone who works at the organization that decides who gets organs gets paid. I have not had to alter my life in any way because I donated. Donating has not affected my overall health in any way. As far as compensation, I would suggest that someone donating a kidney has their student debt wiped out. 13 more real actual dead people today because of the current policy.",
        "Great idea - totally won't create a  ghoulish dystopia where the poor literally have to sell their organs to the rich to survive.",
        "I am glad that the author was lucky and got a kidney. However, selling kidneys and other precious body resources such as plasma is the stuff of neo-liberal dreams. Such a system turns the poor into a biological warehouse for the rich; they can be \"harvested\" at will. American capitalism will never compensate the poor at the level at which it compensates venture capitalists and other \"idle entrepreneurs,\" who when their companies fail are not held accountable the way the poor always are. Kidney donors will be exploited and the kidneys themselves sold at exorbitant profits. Instead, the American healthcare system should be fully funded at taxpayer expense and made universal, equitable, and prevention based. But of course the rich do not want the poor to be healthy.",
        "Unacceptable and unethical. So this writer's argument is to sell organs because you can live with one. Who's is going to be more prone to having to sell their organs? Poor and minority people. So what happens when ( his example) \" Black patients are more than three times as likely to develop kidney failure as white patients\" have a problem with the ONLY kidney they have left. Who is going to come up the $50k donation? And it will be available kidneys for them if wealthy patients bought the kidneys because they have the money to do so?",

        "An ethical version of \"selling kidneys\" would be to provide a future-organ credit to the donor, the donor's partner, and the donor's immediate family. The credit would be non-transferable, and would allow the possessor to receive higher priority status in the queue, which should effectively guarantee timely access to an organ.\n\nNo amount of money would get me to donate a healthy organ to a stranger. However, if I knew that doing so would guarantee that my wife or son would receive priority access in the future, I would be much more likely to donate to a stranger.",

It looks like a slippery slope to me. Where does it end? Even if the prospect of dealing in human organs weren't morally reprehensible, this sort of thing should (even in a marginally sane world) require regulation. But oh, yeah, laissez-faire capitalists will fight to their last  drop of blood to defeat regulation. That this is even the subject of discussion in the Times is odious. Does empathy even exist anymore?",

        "I agree it is a tragedy that so many people die waiting for a kidney. But there is a LOT we can do to improve organ donation from the dead, to reduce the demand through preventative care, and to improve current processes.

And some commenters have said that they would like to sell their kidneys to pay off their college debt or just to have money to buy nice things. Thought experiment: Only allow people who are at a level of affluence equal to four times the poverty level to sell a kidney. So in order for a person to sell a kidney, he or she would have to be a member of a household (two adults and two children), which earns at least about $120,000 a year in income. I suspect there would be many kidney sellers and many lives will be saved by the kidneys they donate. And no desperately poor person would have been coerced by economic circumstances to donate a kidney. But wait one second. How do we think that people whose earnings are below the poverty level are likely to react? I'm guessing they will object to the fact that they are not being allowed to sell a kidney.

        "At face value a very uncomfortable idea, as many comments have attested to. I think the author could and should have gone into greater detail about the moral and physical hazards of such a system.\n\nHowever, we are not being societally consistent when looking at this issue. Many states allow women to be paid for surrogate pregnancies. Pregnancy itself can be a risky affair, in many cases more risky than a surgical procedure to remove a kidney from a healthy donor. Also, we pay our young men and women to join the military (in the form of education scholarships), often putting themselves in harms way, and many times they are enticed by that compensation. This is not to say that these topics are equal. Of course kidney donation puts someone at a lifelong risk of something occurring with their remaining kidney. But I would argue these examples are in the same ballpark - we allow some systems of compensation which tend to encourage economically disadvantaged people to put themselves in harms way. It\u2019s important to consider these other issues because we should strive for moral consistency with our policies. We also don\u2019t live in a utopia - there is indeed a great shortage of kidneys, and we should think creatively about ways to solve this issue, whether by investing more in research in artificial kidney, systems to pay families of deceased individuals to encourage more organ donation at death, and yes, even considering the possibility of paying people for their kidneys in a safe way",

It's a few weeks to 12 year kidneyversary and I've never for a second regretted it. \n\nThe pre-screening takes months and many trips to the hospital for testing and interviews. Many of our family members got screened out. The donation team is absolutely dedicated to doing no harm to their donors, to the point that it often feels overly paternalistic. No one in the process is being paid on commission. Their motivation is to help healthy, willing donors give a lifesaving gift to someone who needs it.\n\nThe recovery involves a lifting restriction for around 8 weeks and means those of us with physical jobs can't work at all during that period. $50k sounds to me like a fair compensation for the amount of time and effort that goes into donation and recovery. This isn't a huge incentive that will convince poor folks to donate a kidney -- it's just reasonable compensation like what's expected for egg donation or surrogacy, but without the variability and potential conflict of interest that comes with private pay. \n\nCurrently, those both giving and receiving donations are much more likely to be in stable/comfortable financial situations. Compensating all donors would go a long way toward allowing those who want to donate to do so without taking on a financial burden in the process.",

Nearly nine in ten on the organ waiting list need kidneys. As a result, taxpayers are paying billions annually through Medicare and Medicaid for weekly dialysis.\n\nThe only way forward is to allow some very carefully controlled sale of kidneys or a technological breakthrough. A few weeks ago doctors successfully transplanted a pig kidney into a 60-year-old man. But it will likely take years more development to make xenotransplantation (animal to human) a sizable difference.\n\nTill then, we have to revamp the current system with some means of fair compensation to willing live donors that doesn't shortchange the poor waiting for transplants.

Those who are the most in need, less able to fend for themselves and have an Advocate suffer at the hands of places like DaVita, the Non unionized Dialysis Centers that treat patients horribly and have the worst staff because the best leave, the worst are tolerated and unsupervised and uncaring and paid less than Fast Food workers while DaVita, a National Dialysis center making Billions from our taxes while billing huge for their services, making and putting money in the wrong places, own pockets and flies under the radar like Medicare Advantage Plans which abuse patients too when they need the expensive tests or care for their ailments as they age. DaVita does not even get new treatment chairs for the Patients. There is no In Service for the staff and no regard for Staff, Patients. Kidney sales or donations would go a long way to putting an end to the suffering of way too many on Dialysis until the end of life. \nNo good reason not to.",

They get old, their kidneys function less well, then they need kidney reserve for themselves. Instead, let us function on growing replacement organs outside the human body, so living donors do not have to get major, risky surgery.",

        "I disagree. The circumstance of being about to die from organ failure doesn\u2019t give us a claim on someone else\u2019s healthy organ, the precise thing having money to purchase an organ confers over that someone who has a desperate need for money. This was made very clear when organ donation was set up. The gift of life was to be anonymous at both ends: recipient never knowing who the donor was and vice versa. Even as it is in the US, you need insurance, money and social support to get the transplant operations many are denied. Kidney sales already blight India\u2019s healthcare scene, and we don\u2019t want that kind of coercion here.\n\nIt\u2019s true we did modify the rules to accommodate living donors, usually family members, to give if willing and thus avoid a risky or unavailable cadaver donation. But this is coercive enough without payment, exerting a pressure on family members to get tested, and to donate if compatible: Even if your loved one doesn\u2019t ask, your shame will never end if you don\u2019t offer. Why exacerbate the ethical conundra of procedures remaining uncommon heroics in our approach to serious illness anyhow? Making the federal government a payer covering only costs of surgery as the author suggests\u2014in effect giving Uncle Sam that claim over those who need money\u2014will not eliminate the racial inequities and ethical problems either one.

It's such an entitled stance to suggest that $50k split over 5 years to \"just\" $10k/year at tax time isn't still somehow a financial windfall for someone worried routinely about how to fill their gas tank or keep food in the fridge. And these same poorer folks most likely to find $50k worth the hassle and risk are also the most likely to develop kidney failure later on owing to myriad social determinants of health related to poverty and stress. So we'll pay a huge cohort of healthy 20-somethings for one of their kidneys, and 20-30 years later when that $50k is long gone and a hard life catches up to their overall health, where will their backup kidneys come from? Will we start buying them from even poorer folks overseas?\n\nI say this as someone for whom kidney disease runs in both sides of my family.

ONLY the persons who have agreed to voluntarily donate organs will voluntarily receive organs, starting from age 21.

The average cost of a new car is around $49K. The economic side seems way off.  Is this just another Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift?  I understand that the author would like to see more kidneys for transplant, but this is so obscene maybe we should just try the Chinese model and just shoot a prisoner when we need one the economics of it would be better, it costs more than 50K a year just to incarcerate one.

It *does not* allow nor incentivize poor people to donate their kidneys in exchange for money.\n\nEvery kidney donation program in the country has an extremely thorough (arguably overly-paternalistic) vetting program that will not allow folks to donate if they suspect they are financially motivated, subject to coercion, or will suffer negative consequences as a result of donation.\n\nWhat this proposal does is provide a credit so that folks who already want to donate can take time off from work without additional stress. In addition to the initial time of from surgery, many donors must take time off from work due to the lifting restrictions after donation. This credit would help people recover some lost wages and would make donation more accessible for folks who already want to donate.",

All of this before the actual trauma (bc there is no other word) of the surgery and then 8 weeks of recovery.  All of this while hoping my husband could hang on until a kidney for him could be found. We are a couple fortunate to have every resource available--family, friends, compassionate work environments, and economic stability and STILL this process was hard as hell. The donation process is not the same for everyone--some have a faster recovery while others, like me, needed a full 8 weeks to feel funcitonal.

How many poor would think, well I really only need one eye so why not sell a cornea too?  How many parents would decide to sell one of their children's organs?  I remember some years ago a story in the news about parents who decided to have another child so that that child could be a donor to another of their children.  Then, there are other types of parents who would sell their children's organs just so that they could buy more drugs.\n\nAnyone think that if any of the super-rich, especially those in tech, found that they needed a donor, would not use tech expertise to sift medical records worldwide in order to find a compatible human to whom they could make an exhorbitant monetary offer to purchase an organ?  Or failing that, use their money to maybe get that organ by nefarious means?\n\nI remember reading a read a piece about 3D bioprinting to create functional vital organs.  <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/15/3d-printed-organs-may-soon-be-a-reality\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/15/3d-printed-organs-may-soon-be-a-reality</a>/\n\nI think 3D bioprinting is well on the way to saving millions of lives.",

        "My uncle saved my father through a kidney donation in 1970. It gave an additional twenty years of life. Owing to the dangers back then. and my father being a physician, both he and the transplant surgeon spent a long time explaining the potentially fatal consequences to my uncle. He risked not only his life, but those of my aunt and three cousins. And at that time, there were many who believed such an operation was unethical, that it violated the first tenet of medicine: \"Physician, do no harm.\"\n\nI'm deeply and forever grateful my uncle went through with the surgery to save my father, but extremely troubled by the idea of legalizing organ sales. Inequality in this country is bad enough, both economically and for healthcare, without introducing economics into organ donation. \n\nToo many in this country are denied access to health care through lack of wealth and income. Making life-saving organ transplants available to those with wealth, privilege, and influence while denying it to those who lack it -- and that would be the case -- is health care rationing under another name. Regardless of proposed \"safeguards,\" people would rarely offer a kidney absent economic desperation. Coercion is not always external. Economic desperation would remain a potential factor in any decision to take such a risk. There is enough economic desperation already without exploiting it under the guise of altruism. The human body is not an ATM machine, and organ donations still risk fatal consequences.",

It will be justified by disqualifying the poorer person by assuming without evidence or specious evidence. \n\nI knew one such patient for whom I called an ambulance. Over my objections and support from a female fire department helper, they decided to Baker Act, calling in the police to make it legal. They brought him to a local for-profit hospital, which suffered from a reputation of malicious psychiatrists, over my objections.\n\nInstead of being treated for his illness, he was routed to a psychiatrist who declared him suicidal. He self medicated for knee pain with alcohol sometimes mixed with painkillers, while awaiting a \"J\" card to obtain help for his knee from Jackson, a public hospital, which gives excellent care to the underinsured.\n\nThe last I saw him, he was coherent but ornery, an athletic man, early 60s, walking steadily to the ambulance. Three days after entry to the hospital, I found him lying in a bed too short for his stature, intubated, with no food or hydration being given him intravenously. His kidney function weakened and he was given dialysis so painful that his face twisted and grimaced during it. Eventually, he died, after several weeks of horrific cruelty, where nurses assumed role of doctors to help him when doctors would not.\n\nThe healthcare industry is too profit driven as it is.",
        "I think more people might donate kidneys if it had a future benefit for them and their families -- if there were a guarantee that they'd be near the top of the waiting list if in the future they needed a kidney.\n\nI did look into this at one point. Something I thought about was what if one day I, or someone else in my family, needs a kidney and I would have been a match? Had I gone forward with donation, I would have been able to list five people who should be given priority in the event that they need a kidney in the future. But at least at that stage in the process, it was really unclear what \"given priority\" meant. And I wouldn't have known about this at all if I hadn't already been digging into what the process entails.\n\nI think this is a place where the government could step in to make it clear that if a donor or one of their loved ones needs a kidney in the future, they will be put at the top of the list (i.e., right below all the donors before them, and above non-donors, who need a kidney); and the government would also be able to get the word out that this the policy. And this would be better than keeping both your kidneys just in case a family member needs one (if that's your only reason for not donating), since you're far from guaranteed to be a match for them.",

It is big money for the healthcare providers to do transplants and there is a far amount of pressure put on people to donate their organs, without compensation.

It is a win-win situation for the industry.\n\nBut the ethics even get murkier if we were to pay donors - it is almost guaranteed that people who are desperate for cash are going to be selling their own body parts, and the pressure on families to sell organs of dying loved ones will be a disgusting scene played out in ICUs. Will we have bidding wars over organs? \n\nI feel badly for the people who need organs but I am also deeply troubled by an industry built upon trading human body parts.",

        "I donated a kidney to a friend with a hereditary kidney disease and was only able to do so because I have a job that supported my donation by giving me the necessary time off and job security to take the risk. Ironically, under the current system only the relatively well off are able to make a living kidney donation because the transplant hospital must verify that you have the financial resources available to cover the costs associated with donation (travel, missed work, etc.) This creates a two-tiered system where affluent kidney recipients are more likely to receive a living donation than poor recipients. People are financially compensated for donating eggs, sperm, blood, plasma, and surrogacy. Why should kidneys be any different?",

It is a privilege to be healthy and have the capacity to give life which I hold humbly and quietly. \n\nAspects that are missing from the writer's argument\n\n1) a barrier to donation is lack of paid time off from work in order to recover (which I did not have-and had to jump back into work 2 weeks post-op and caring for those aforementioned children-4 of them who can be real pickles sometimes)\n\n2) The recipient must be able to have the means (ie insurance), tenacity (the anti-rejection meds are ceaseless and the regime strict), and ability to alter their lifestyle permanently (being immunosuppressed is HARD work and I think like making peace with living with an undercurrent of fear). \n\n3) I was deemed to be a good candidate because I am fine-mentally & physically and if I become unwell I have the ability to access health care.

And, its very easy to think of people who want $50,000 for something  - college, starting a business, law or medical school, paying off student loans etc. - and who would both severely regret and die early from the donation of a kidney.  Its hard to see how changing how the money would be paid is helpful except at the margins: it would cut off folks who want Ferraris but not those wanting Law Degrees. \nAnd, regrettably, most of these folks strike me as being young persons who can not easily anticipate or appreciate future health challenges.

Non-utilitarian moral systems, such as virtue ethics, certainly don't forbid being compensated for helping others. If you find it repugnant and disgusting to donate a kidney for compensation, don't do it! But don't keep it illegal for those of us who want to help.\nI am financially secure, but I have not donated yet because a few weeks off from work would negatively impact my career. A refundable tax credit would help me feel secure in donating my kidney, which would save a life and save the government the cost of dialysis. Many comments express concern for the poor, who may donate out of desperation, which is a worthwhile concern. But there are many poor people who need kidneys dying on the transplant list. Spending time on dialysis that could be spent with their families. We could improve their lives while improving the lives of the donors by compensating kidney donors and save money while doing it.

Donating a kidney while alive is a sacrifice one should make freely and willingly, not because one needs to feed their own family.  We should do a better job of encouraging organ donation at death and also encourage a healthy lifestyle so adult onset diabetes and the accompanying kidney failure don\u2019t occur.",
        "The objection being voiced, of course, is that \"poor people\" will be encouraged to sell kidneys, while \"rich people\" won't be under pressure to do so.

Poor people often work harder, more dangerous jobs that rich people don't do. Think coal miners, garbage collectors, hod carriers, agricultural field workers. Society will allow people to do jobs that will make them sick and live shorter lives, but prevents them from donating a kidney, a relatively low risk thing to do, something that many people freely do, for loved ones, and, even strangers. And this illogical situation results in thousands of deaths each year, of individuals who die because kidneys are not available for transplant.",
        "Programs that procure kidney donations have an extensive and lengthy process of screening potential donors, so someone wanting the money would not automatically be sent to surgery. There are plenty of other bodily substances that can compensate the donor for donation, like sperm and eggs, so why not for other parts of the body? Kidney donation programs have worked hard to get rid of disincentives for donations, such as wage and travel reimbursement, which I\u2019m certain has opened the door for many to donate. Adding more programs like this will get more people to test, and therefore more people may be eligible to donate. Throughout the entire process, up to the moments before surgery, a donor can decide not to donate. So why shouldn\u2019t we provide more to donors? From a strictly economic standpoint, those on dialysis cost the taxpayer an exorbitant amount of money over the lifespan, along with a shorter life expectancy and increase in disruptive life events for the patient (like the inability to work). With a program like this, more people\u2019s lives are saved and the economy benefits from diminished health care costs and more folks able to participate in the workforce. Its a no brainer.",

I was always struck by an article they published about two decades ago which demonstrated the difference in quality of life for those who sold a kidney (and of course usually a poorer person than the buyer).  85% of them regretted what they had done. The experience of selling an organ left the majority them with lifelong quality of life and psychosocial issues.  It is not a panacea for the heartbreaking failure of organ shortage.\n\n   A large group of articles can be found on the PubMed NIH site, available to everyone on the issues and outcomes of the world's only legal kidney market .",
        "As an undirected living kidney donor, I wholeheartedly agree. The decision to donate a kidney is a profound one, and while it\u2019s not motivated by financial gain, understanding and addressing the financial implications for donors is crucial. It\u2019s about ensuring donors are supported and not disadvantaged by their generosity. The conversation around compensation isn\u2019t about commodifying donation; it\u2019s about recognizing and alleviating the real costs donors incur. This approach can ultimately support the altruistic spirit of donation and help more people consider this life-saving gift.",

I had known several donors in my world of running and triathlon and after watching a video about a friend's cousin in need, I felt an instant desire to try to help someone live. I had to wait to pursue it while my daughter finished grad school and then reached out to Montefiore Hospital regarding donating to a stranger. It was one of the most important and meaningful decisions of my life. I fully support the Coalition to Modify NOTA's plan to assist living donors with tax credits. I do not support the buying and selling organs.  The goal is to support those who make selfless decisions to support family members, colleagues and strangers like me who want to help. Help someone live, give someone more time with their families, let them see their children grow up, let their children live.",

Now in my late 60s I have two kidneys but only about 50% kidney function.  That's not so bad at my age, but if I'd donated one, I would now have 50% of one kidney, which wouldn't be enough.  So I think giving away a kidney has to be recognized as a sacrifice. It's not like giving up spare parts that you don't have a use for.  Should we pay people to make that kind of sacrifice?

People should be allowed to make their own decisions. That said a \"refundable tax credit\" doesn't sound like anyone is being \"paid\" - what happens if you die before the period of refundable credits is up?  We're just giving the government an extended \"kidney loan?\" That part of this idea doesn't pass muster - if organs can be donated for heavens sake pay people what they are worth and it's more than 50 grand - if you donate and end up with endless health problems afterwards what good does a refundable tax credit do you?

In front of the hospitals, especially hospitals that specialize in urology, all the walls are covered with flyers: ads from people trying to sell their kidneys. The flyers, often handwritten, include a phone number, blood type, and price. \nPeople in need sell kidneys to cover rent, car payments, college tuition, medical expenses of their own or their families. And the \"competition\" to sell kidneys has driven the prices low. The genetic lottery of the blood type impacts the price of the kidney too. \n\nWhile I agree it would be nice if donors are compensated, the idea of having an open market for organs is a bit too dystopian, and can end up with donors being taken advantage of, or open a new way for the poor to suffer.",

There should also be plans for a complication or disability afterward.\n\nWe should educate people on the feasibility and relative safety of donating and the process -- many people have some strange misconceptions about it \n\nPaying people encourages people to lie during screening and opens up a can of worms on consent.  There are all kinds of overt and subtle ways of coercion.  It turns organs into commodities.  \n\nThe single biggest reason I trusted the process was being told over and over that I could walk away at any time, right up to the moment they put me under, and all anyone would be told was that I'd been disqualified.

My understanding is that a person with one kidney has to be very careful about diet and lifestyle to maintain their health. Beyond the possible complications from the major surgery, they would have to be careful about substances, drugs and infections. That burden would not be worth the proposed tax credits, especially when those who would consider this would actually need cash. The standard deduction is now more than many people's income. The value of a kidney should be 200K or more given the lifelong ramifications. That probably would make it on par with dialysis. This brings up a deeper issue of why we in developed countries cling to life so selfishly, sequestering enormours resources, while life in developing countries is exploited and death an accepted reality.",

A living kidney is the gold standard of kidney care. When someone moves from dialysis to transplant, $450,000 are saved. The End Kidney Deaths Act  is a 10 year pilot that will provide every American who donates a kidney to a stranger with a $50,000 refundable tax credit. Only 300 people donate kidneys to strangers annually. This bill will raise that number of around 6,000. By year 10, 60,000 American lives & $14 billion in taxes will be saved. \nAn intensive physical and mental health screening to qualify for donation is required, leading to donors living longer than the general population. Donation is twice as safe as childbirth. \nIt's estimated that less than 1/3 of Americans would be healthy enough to qualify to donate. Donation costs the donor roughly 10% of their annual salaries in lost wages & travel costs. Right now, most who give kidneys to strangers are middle or high income.

It just ain\u2019t so all the time. There are surgical complications of the donor and the recipient. There can be frequent bouts of rejection and the need for strong immunosuppression and subsequent complications of that. Most people have no idea of the horror of graft vs host disease or of immunosuppression-associated lymphoma. Most people do not understand the time limits of expected organ function. Very disappointing are the instances when recipients fail to follow medication schemes, and their organs reject and fail of their own ignorance of advice and care. Some people have kidney diseases that eventually appear in the transplant also. Amidst this, the author wants to make organ procurement into a market?",
        "Here is the sad reality.\nHumans are mortal.\nWe die from many causes.\nWe die at many different ages. \nPoverty and/or genes can contribute to early disease and death.\n\nSomeone poor lost the lottery of where you are born in the socioeconomic scale. Someone who has a congenital disease lost the lottery of healthy genes.\n\nMorally, why should the poor person give up a healthy kidney (that they themselves may later need) to save the person with kidney disease? Especially when whatever we decide to pay will not lift the poor person out of poverty. So they will still face poor health outcomes due to poverty.\n\nWhile morally, I am opposed to payment for this, let\u2019s do the thought exercise,  To be equivalent, we would have to pay an amount like 300,000 tax free, but arguably more. (According to the U.S. Census data, the average net worth for U.S. households in 2022 is about $300,000). Is this what the author has in mind (?) This really seems to be a moral hazard. \n\nI understand and appreciate that someone with kidney disease does not like being saddled with poor genetics. But this is true for so many things in life that affect health and longevity outcomes. \n\nWe would all be wise to philosophically internalize the fact that we are mortal.  Every day/year is a gift. \n\nThe poor are not here to serve us even though this is the economic system we have chosen to create. This is also something to contemplate",

Yes, people who donate their kidneys ought to be compensated fully for their expenses and lost work time and in case their remaining kidney fails at a future date.

Receiving appropriate and timely care should never be dependent upon one's popularity or ability to appeal to the public.  That Americans feel they must do that is a disgrace and reveals a lot about our national character.",
        "Poor people would be pressured to sell body parts, an exploitation that \"saves lives\" for the affluent and insured, yes, but shifts their medical precarity and risks onto the least privileged in society.

Unless, of course, you're rich.",
        "Additional safeguard to consider: if you sell a kidney through this system, but develop kidney disease youreself, you automatically jump to the top of the list and recieve a fresh one for free. \n\nThis largely deals with the problem of someone providing a kidney who turns out to need one in future.  You have less need for a spare if you know you are at the top of the list in time of need.",

I lost my beloved stepfather at 12 because a donor heart didn't become available in time; I wouldn't wish that on anyone.\n\nHaving the legal option to sell a kidney (obviously through a well-thought out system) that ensures informed consent, full coverage of the expenses associated with organ donation for both the donor and recipient, as well as lifetime follow-up care and monitoring, would be a complete game changer. And the is already such a system that's been doing these exact things for decades...just ask Iran, the only country that allows the 'sale' of kidneys. The mortality rate for those who require a transplant and that of donors is far lower that in the United States or any other so-called 'First World' countries. Perhaps it far past time to study and implement such a system here.",
        "The idea that we must save everyone runs a bit counter to the actual cruelness of the American people and the medical system that exploits them. Everything is about money for the wealthy.

I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I had another spare kidney to give. \n\nDespite all that, I strongly support compensating kidney donors through a federal payment system like the one outlined here. There aren't enough close family members, gone-too-soon young people, or weirdos like me to get everyone a kidney that needs one. I have spent countless hours discussing my donation with others, trying to get them to consider nondirected kidney donation for themselves, and the conversation almost always goes nowhere.\n\nPut aside your gut reaction to this proposal for a moment and imagine thousands of people dying every year for no good reason. It's more expensive to let these people die. It's more painful. It's worse in every conceivable way. This proposal can stop that onslaught of human suffering. One might think: we can stop it already!

They have super fast machines that suck fluids out of you and quickly extract the money product, returning the red blood cells and some saline.

It is also disgusting and should be illegal.  \n\nThe author is wrong to think that a process where the government controlled such a thing  as organ barvesting could occur.  The lucrative nature would drive this to the money.  And the poor would be the source of the organs.  Even if the government ran this show, it would still be the poor who provided the organs and would suffer the risks associated with such a procedure.

Most are illiterate and in low-paid manual jobs, their sole reason for donating not borne of altruism but to pay off debt. In Pakistan many individuals donate kidneys to release themselves from bonded slavery but have insufficient capital to make a new life and often return to debt... We find it difficult to relate to concepts such as the entrapment represented by bonded slavery but how would our society view individuals in our own country driven to donate a kidney to pay off credit card debt, college fees or to satisfy a drug problem?\n\nSadly for the majority of donors, selling a kidney does not result in the significant economic benefit of which they dreamed. Often it is associated with a decline in general health. Many fall back into debt, often compounded by the inability to work following donation due to ill health. Supporters of paid donation argue that a person should have the basic right to choose the fate of his or her organs. In the setting of paid donation, informed consent is often of dubious quality, with the risks of surgery often not being properly explained or understood.

Look at the horrors in other places caused by the wealthy patients flying into poorer countries to cannibalize body parts from the desperate. My spouse was on dialysis for over two decades; we did the treatments at home daily because the dialysis industry only allowed for thrice weekly treatments, which is the historical arrangement driven by for-profit companies who wanted a business model that accommodated scheduling NOT physiology.
