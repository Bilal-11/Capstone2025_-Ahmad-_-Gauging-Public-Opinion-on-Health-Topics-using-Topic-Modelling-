        "Designer babies, the most direct way to a future of idiots. Haven't we learned the anytal wisdom of evolutons randomness? I understand trying to avoid illness, what is considered desirable now is in effect a fad with unkwown future implications. Take for example intelligence, the fact is we don,t even truly understand the concept, never mind have an inkling of the myriad if genes involved in it. For all we know the few genes that we suspect might be associated with it may also be associated directly with other characteristics that have other deleterious effects Another great example is height, it happens to have a direct relationships with dying earlier from cardiovascular disease. As we all know, there are not many, if any, 90 y/o 7 foot people around! Trying to select genes for what we vainly consider \"better\" attributes in not only ignorant, it's also dangerous and ultimately counterproductive. It's classic eugenics and we know where that leads. There is no ubermensch. It's a fantasy for the feebleminded and otherwise insecure.",

        "Be it AI or genetic trait selection, we hurtle toward these anti-human forces, and I don't think they can be reined in. It is to our detriment.",
        "I have a daughter, as part of our pregnancy journey, we screened for health issues, and they did genetic testing too. Thank God everything was fine, a few warnings about health issues that could arise .\nI don't know how I would have reacted if there was something truly wrong.\nBut I am against the general idea to optize a baby based on genetic choosing.  It seems wrong.",
        "There is a very clear ethical line here. If the embryo is screened for fetal anomalies or genetic disorders that will severely impact their health or quality of life, it is moral to share that information with parents and allow them to decide what to do next. If the embryo is screened for gender, intelligence, physical traits, or other markers of \"preference\" then this is eugenics. If you don't have an issue with people screening for these preferences then you cannot have an issue with millions of fetuses being aborted across the globe because they are female.",
        "I've always argued this is the natural end point of evolution. It already is. The capability to self-evolve is selectively advantageous and we see this in other organisms that have more universal drives (i.e., they do a form of directed evolution to help them survive/reproduce).  Our immune system is an example of internal evolution with the exception that for the most part as far as we know it is not inherited but that's not so black and white. \n\nSome of the drives humans have are illusory in that they are due to cultural conditioning and therefore will lead to dissatisfaction. It's one thing to want a child to be healthy but another to be more attractive (whatever that means), etc. \n\nWhat this type of engineering will do is create a population vulnerable to bottlenecks. So when a crisis comes to which adaptation isn't possible fast enough, the survival capability of the species will be diminished.\n\nRegardless, this is inevitable for the reasons I've stated above. The ability to do directed genetic engineering is selectively advantageous in and of itself. However using this ability unwisely will cause a lot of issues. On a population level, this experimentation is fine (say bacteria doing this). On a human level, it will cause suffering when done unwisely.",
        "My wife and I are currently deep in the IVF process. Throughout the entire process you are truly deciding on ethical dilemma after ethical dilemma. Known or unknown sperm donor, how to select your sperm donor (do you take into account physical traits? attractiveness?), how much genetic testing do you want to do, do you donate leftover IVF medication since doctors offices can't legally pass it on to other patients. \n\nWhat you learn going through this is that there is a LOT of information out there and a ton of businesses and fertility clinics that have strong conflicts of interest. Articles like this are incredibly helpful, however, I would strongly recommend anyone going through this to look at research and first hand accounts from the actually people who were created this way. There are many stories of these \"designer\" babies who one day turned into an adult and learned how they were selected. Or children that grew up with an unknown donor and face challenges related to that every day. \n\nAll we can do is try our best and make the best choices with the information we have at hand. However, I would say 90% of the people featured in this article are not doing that.",
        "I wish the article had pushed back on the premise that complex traits like intelligence can be screened for in the first place more. Anyone who knows anything about genetics knows that traits with a clear, identified gene responsible are the exception, not the norm. Most traits and diseases are the results of complex interactions of genetics, genetics,  environment, etc. Often genes that are identified are just the most statistically relevant, and hardly a certainty. It's honestly almost more dangerous to think that such things can be known with any degree of certainty, at least right now. To screen for anything but the most well-understood, most likely diseases for a given family is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nParenthood is a risk. Life is a risk. To try and control everything is futile and foolish.",
        "Please do not let the valid concerns mentioned in this piece detract from the fact that IVF\u2014and PGT-A, which screens for chromosomal abnormalities that could prevent an embryo from developing at all\u2014is a medical necessity for some couples. I just gave birth to my first child through IVF with PGT-A, after four failed embryo transfers. After two transfers of untested embryos, PGT-A gave us some hope that the genetically normal embryos might turn into a healthy child. Failing to acknowledge the medical necessity of IVF in some people\u2019s fertility and family building only makes it more likely that access to these important treatments is curtailed.",
        "To anyone who has grown up with a debilitating medical condition, or experienced that later in life, how absolutely wonderful it would be to not have had to deal with all those years of suffering.  I\u2019m all for testing in that case.  In terms of testing for other traits such as height, I don\u2019t have a problem with that either IF it is accurate.  I do worry though about what would happen to children who don\u2019t meet the expectations of their parents to be a certain way.  Would they be rejected, or worse, mistreated?  Maybe there should be a stringent test for parents.  Not everyone should be one.",
        "If we want healthy, well-adjusted children, how about prioritizing policies that lead to children being healthy and well-adjusted? I would never fault anyone for trying to avoid passing on a genetic disease that causes distress and disability. But as for the rest... Why are we trying to fix nature and not nurture, when the former is so much more dangerous and an ethical minefield?",
        "Interesting and well-written article which illuminates many questions. I love babies and was fortunate to have two healthy daughters, but genetic testing is quite different from the \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 concept that the world needs more people! The earth already has far too many humans, and nature and other animals are hurting as a result.",
        "The implicit assumption here is that pain and difficulty should be avoided.  I'm not sure that's right (and not really smart enough to figure it out on my own!).  My own experience is that pain and difficulty, when random and not imposed by a third party, are important in any society even if tragic at an individual level.  At a societal scale, I am just not convinced that individual optimizations are consistent with any useful theory of a public good.  Instead, this idea of optionality encourages us to be consumers (selecting the babies we want, engineering them when our bodies bump into their natural limits) and not investors (nurturing the babies we have, making peace with the notion that children are not an entitlement).",
        "It is yet another unethical study (only in my opinion) which could potentially harm children in the name of science. I am a firm believer in medicines and vaccines for children because they save lives which are backed by real scientific studies. Behavior science starting with IQ test has ruined many lives because \"metric\" or \"measurement\" is subjective. Children have different reactions or responses at toddler age or even pre-teens. A subjective test can lead to wrong decisions made for children. How many lives have been altered by the IQ test. How many children have been put in slow developmental classes because of one test. More dangerous situation would be the reactions from parents. These subjective tests can altered how a child is being raised or nurtured. Extra pressure would potentially cause harmful parenthood.",

The foetuses could be contaminated during their mother\u2019s pregnancy, leading to less favorable results than expected. Actually, the fact of using energy-intensive practices to \u2018make\u2019 babies increases the likelihood of the foetuses encountering adverse developmental conditions (microplastics, polluted water and air, etc).  Besides, what\u2019s the point of having \u2018perfect\u2019 children in an environment with less and less drinkable water and air contaminated by wildfires?

Let mean school children gossip and speculate about which of their classmates was made in a lab. Let, \"you were made to be better than this!\" slip out in a heated exchange between parent and teen.

        "We used PGT to screen for a (in my view) serious and life limiting single gene disorder. We now have unaffected children. \n\nAnd yet, reading many of the quotes from screening companies made me feel nauseous. The couple who created 40 embryos to pick the most appealing ones have a view of the value of children that particularly turns my stomach. I recognize the \u201cGattica\u201d questions this technology poses, but beyond that I worry it promotes a view of what a good life is, what a good family is, that is so deeply sad.",
        "All of those babies are very cute and I am glad that people are creating families. But they aren't cuter than other babies. This is just to say that the naturally created ones are still a much loved and welcomed outcome.\nI had a very severely intellectually limited and physically deformed sibling. She had a hard time of it and the family had a hard time of it. Not having this happen to anyone would be good. People who argue about God's will and how it makes everyone better through prayer and sacrifice have a right to their thoughts but I don't think they should be able to decide for the rest of us.\nScreening  for terrible genetic diseases and conditions makes sense to me. Fiends who had a baby daughter die at 3 from a brainstem tumor might have wanted a very different journey and they loved her very much but her last weeks were just terrible. And they mourned her hard until their own dying days. But when we start selecting for height, weight, nose shape, eye color, musical talent, athleticism it starts to seem fraught.\nAnd intellect is made up of a lot of genes as is talent or athleticism or mechanical intelligence. We know what we are doing and natural selection needs variety to work. Also skewing the sex ratio in either direction is not a good idea. We already watched the Chinese experiment unfold. All this talk of girls are easier, more tractable, better in school ...well, wait until there are really not enough men to go around and see how nice and sweet the girls are.",
        "Is \"careful selection of babies\" the successor of the now mostly defunct eugenics movement? Both screening before birth and killing after is a choice. Killing is a choice that most societies now find objectionable; ironically many societies find it less objectionable to let a child with disabilities languish.\n\nScreening poses a different ethical question because life before birth is (to me) not personhood. A religious person would object of course.\n\nTaking my point of view, screening becomes a question of choice, similarly to \"what color should I paint the room\"? The choice of \"what baby?\" of course has much bigger ramifications, both financially and ethically. \n\nBut choosing is not new. The means are changing. For example I married a person that is intellectually my peer and it appears my offsprings have a similar intellectual capability as their parents. That is a form of choice I suppose that is seen by most people as not objectionable. \n\nSimilar with screening there is a sliding scale. On one hand eliminating the possibility for a baby with Down syndrome, I suppose, is seen by most as ok. On the other hand custom selection of the baby's properties appears less acceptable. \n\nAt the end the collective society has to make the detailed decisions. That will take more than a generation, as in the case of eugenics.",

        "The erosion of human dignity is a clear consequence here, as anyone with any trait deemed undesirable is implicitly branded as one who ought to have been eliminated prior to reaching such a state of maturation. As the author notes in a comment, a diagnosis of down syndrome is automatic warrant for execution in some countries. How do those with down syndrome feel about that? They're being told that their lives are NOT worth living. Who gets to decide who counts as a human with a life worth continuing? Is a further consequence the automatic exclusion of the genetically compromised from the community of those allowed to reproduce? \nAnother, deeper consequence is the further erosion of seeing life as gift over which we do not have total control. Will those who seek children naturally be regarded as selfish and reckless? The insanity of that stance is so troubling.

There are two main types of testing: PGTA for chromosomal abnormalities and PGTM for known genetic diseases (such as Tay Sachs). IVF doctors will then advocate for the disposal of any embryo that is not \"normal.\" However, these doctors do not then provide the option to \"fix\" any embryos say, through the use of, CRISPR, because that is not an accepted practice and is seen as unethical.

Everyone must have at least one chromosome, but sex is not necessarily a binary concept. Testes may also be undescended, and the biological sex looks like female, but is actually male.

In addition, the countries that tightly regulate the use of PGT are ignoring other ethical issues. For instance, in Germany it is illegal to test them without applying to a medical ethics board, which grants this only in very rare cases of a proven genetic illness. Testing simply for euploidy is not allowed, raising the risk of miscarriage. It doesn\u2019t matter if a woman has had ten miscarriages - her suffering is not enough of a reason to check whether the embryos being transferred even have a chance of success. Or if multiple embryos in a row fail to implant, there is no way to know if the reason was an aneuploid embryo or implantation problems with the uterine environment. Women are simply told to try over and over again - and many run out of embryos and time. Banking embryos for a future pregnancy is also illegal due to a \u201crights of the embryo\u201d act - all embryos from one round of IVF must be used before doing another one, even if a women is of advanced age or has a severely diminished ovarian reserve. \n\nI\u2019m thankful the US doesn\u2019t have such restrictions, and I don\u2019t trust politicians who don\u2019t even understand how babies get made naturally to make more laws surrounding reproduction.",
