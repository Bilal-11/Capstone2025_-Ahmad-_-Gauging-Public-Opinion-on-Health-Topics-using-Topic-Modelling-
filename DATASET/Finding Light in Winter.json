        "This piece is why I keep my subscription to the Times, and also why it rankles me. The politics are shoe-horned into the poetry, like there are boxes that needs ticking. Climate change. Check. Fentanyl. Check. Ukraine, Israel and Gaza. Check. \"Dsyfunctional government\" -- has it ever been otherwise? I can't believe the author of the rest of this artful piece wrote those artless words. The editors got their hands into the mix, I'd guess. Keep the first sentence, cut the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs, and you keep all the grace",

There is dysfunction in our government in the form of a Republican-led House that has passed only 22 bills this year, and whose agenda seems to be to cause chaos.",

Cardinals, goldfinches, now winter drab, titmice, nuthatches, downy, hairy and red bellied woodpeckers and juncos, purple finches, the comical chickadees that will land on my hand if I offer seeds and be still, are all business, the weather doesn\u2019t get them down, the squirrels are the same way.

But growing up in South India it was welcome respite from heat followed by rains. I am so happy to know of, and largely share, the author's successful quest for equanimity and harmony. What might she offer the young caught up in 24/7 work punctuated by social media breaks and subjected to instantaneous reports of war, misery, catastrophe and wanton destruction, I wonder.",

        "What an inspiring essay.  Upon reading the first few paragraphs, I was looking for 'light' within the words, and must admit that I thought that 'there's no light here'.  But as I continued to read, I could identify with all the points that the author made.  And YES, there is light no matter how dark we feel when we focus on all the pain and suffering there is in the world at this moment.  Thank you for the reminder that there is hope and light if we are willing to open our eyes, ears and hearts to the twittering of birds and the smiles of strangers as we meet them in our daily lives.  \nI will share this essay with family and friends.

Someone else enjoys the early morning and late afternoon light.  I get autumn light bounced through my windows via tall buildings at those times of day.  It is magical to me.

Adams, in the Pacific chain of volcanos, sits a monastery dedicated to loving kindness, following the teachings of the zen master you mention. My neighbor has sponsored a family from the Ukraine, echoing your sponsorship. I realize that many of us, in these darkened times, are, in our own way, trying to make a difference, lighting our own candles, clinging to a hope that the pendulum will shift in the opposite direction before too late. May it be so.",

        "Having lost my husband last year and a dear neighbor 2 days ago I have been struggling to find the light in these dark days.  Drawn by the incredible use of light in Monet\u2019s painting I read the article. It confirms that we all have love and light to give each other no matter what our circumstances may be.  A simple smile, offered hug, or listening ear can help ease the sadness and stress that many of us feel these days.",

        "When I returned home from my mother\u2019s long hospice and death in November last year, I acutely felt the dark, cold winter creeping in. So I bought an inexpensive cozy duvet cover online and hung white strands of lights from the curtain rod. During the day I move around to the sunniest spots in the house with my laptop and look forward to retreating to my warming, comforting sanctuary at night. Add long midday walks with friends or family and early evenings in our festively lit small downtown shops, pubs, and cafes. Thanks for this piece.",
        "A colleague and I were once discussing whether we are entering a new Dark Age. He reminded me of the monks who brought us, one manuscript at a time, out of the previous Dark Ages. I asked: what should we do? He said as teachers, we can light at least one candle in our students' souls to replace each of us; if possible, light at least two. The latter leads to exponential growth of light as each of those two lights two more. Eventually, the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness overcometh it not.",

        "I completely agree that enjoying the outdoors during the winter makes them so much more tolerable.  About 20 years ago I was ready to move out of Minnesota and leave the cold winters long behind, but I decided rather than leaving my family that I would learn to embrace winter.  I started cross country skate skiing and now I actually look forward to all four seasons of the year.  Winter has it's own beauty that shouldn't be ignored.

        "Yes, life has and always will include   darkness and light. \n\nA quiet walk in the nature will bring peace to our overdistracted minds and bruised souls. When I hurt I go outside and ask trees to for strength and wisdom and forgiveness for human folly. \n\nStars still shine, birds still sing and life giving water will still rain from the sky until the last moment.\n\nIf only we could see the unparalleled beauty around us and realize it's value.\n\nIf only we could wake up from our sleepwalking  mentality and protect that which needs to be protected.",

        "An exquisite easy that I appreciate so much during these dark times. As a Christian it brought to mind the phrase from John's Gospel, \"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\" The truth of that statement for me is that we all -regardless of our identity - can be light in the darkness and dispel the gloom that threatens us. Reading this essay dispelled darkness for me today. I am grateful.",
        "Dr. Mary:  \n                                 Like so many readers I was touched by this excursus into the Spirit.  It makes me think that maybe the Light of the World really does shine on us, after all.\n\n                                  Moreover, in a personal sense, you touched off a light that shined on me one hot but darkening summer day several years ago when in the Sand Hills of Nebraska I happened across that beautiful Tower of Saint Anselm's Church in the tiny town of Anselmo.  It was for just a moment a small kind of epiphany.\n\n                                   And so, for Christmas this year, I'm going to send a small contribution to that Church and its people, thanks to you.  The small Church with a big, beautiful tower in a tiny town in the vast Sand Hills.   Peace to you, Dr. Pipher and to the New Times for publishing this piece--and to the many fellow commenters.   Maybe the Light Shines in the Darkness, after all.   Let us hope.",
        "Hello Mary,\nI am also a therapist and a senior citizen. Bringing light into the darkness was also a theme that I shared when I worked as a recreation director for an organization that houses formerly homeless people in NYC. We lit Christmas trees,  Hanukkah menorahs and Kwanzaa candles together and shared stories about holidays past and present. I miss those moments during the holidays since my work ended there in 2018. Thank you for this article and happy holidays to you and your family.",
        "I needed this. I find myself close to weeping at the cruelty and thoughtlessness in the world, and these short, dark days seem to emphasize what's wrong. Pipher is an empathetic, graceful person and while she manages more optimism than I can muster, she reminds me to try harder.",

        "I was in my 30s before I learned that many got sad in winter, just like me. That knowledge was liberating, and I took the cold and grey on with gusto. The waves are better in winter, so I surfed more, not less, with heavier wetsuits. I started wearing Borsalino hats and the cheaper cashmere trench coats with my suits. I golfed in the light rain, with the best gear, on empty fairways. In heavier rain, I ride my gravel bike, wearing all the good kit.  In short, I've made my own darn light, right here on the frozen tundra of Southern California. See you at the beach this Xmas!",

        "Lovely Mary.  Yes I too am balancing being present, opening my heart to suffering and beauty and feeling grateful for my life at this moment.  I do believe we can work towards a permanent ceasefire, towards peace and human rights for all.  Right now at this moment 18 Jewish elderly women have chained themselves to the gates of the White House calling for a ceasefire.  For me it is important to use my voice and body for peace.  We all can use whatever our resources and abilities allow.  As elders we have our experiences to share from previous struggles for peace and can also use them to save this beautiful blue planet.",
        "Ms. Pipher, thank you.... I'm feeling blue, oh so blue. I lost my younger son earlier this year and without his physical presence no longer on this realm, some moments, propel me into a darkness I did not know existed.  And then, I go deep, really deep inside me, and try to do exactly the things you list...find the light, a glimmer of it.....and it comes, when my  my loving husband holds me, when I speak to my parents who are still alive, the birds chirp and sing, other people smile at me; or when my older son calls me  and I hear his baritone loving voice; and when I think of the memories of my younger son, one of the smartest persons I have known.... and yes,...there is the light.....Yesterday, at church, I came and hugged the pianist after our service concluded.  I told him that his music had brought so much peace to my heart. I held him; and then saw his face lit up; and  then went on to hug others in the church choir and we held each other.  That's what we all need, we need to hold each other to see the light.  Thank you for a wonderful and contemplative article. Peace. Peace. Peace for all.",
        "This is lovely. It's exactly the conclusion I've been coming to as well ... With the world such a dark place these days, I cannot take it all in any more. Nor do I feel like I can do anything about it. It is too much for one person to take on or even fully grasp. Lately I've just been trying to appreciate and take joy in the good things--the light--that's within my reach.",
        "Thank you for bringing light into my day.  Appreciate you more than I can express.  Peace to you.",

        "Yes, very nice essay..... When we need light, we must not depend on our \"screens\" for it, we must look within ourselves, and to others;  and, to sources bright and colorful, and that seemingly can be out-of-place.  To be fair, our attention to these screens can be helpful:  we can read such an essay as this;  we can wrap ourselves up in a read from Ms. Renkl;  we can enjoy and be lit up a bit by the \"replies and comments and enhancements\" of our fellow Times readers....  what a treat !  Or, a favorite book, and near a window please.  \n   Let me throw another quote on the table:  \"Instructions for living a life:  pay attention, be astonished, tell about it.\"  Mary Oliver, Poet.",

But I grew up in Illinois (long ago) where we did.  \n\nAnd reading that phrase, I remembered.  Yes!  I've seen it. Long ago. \n\nOr the birds that sound like \"temple bells.\"  Is that so?

And he created (January, 1900) a poem about a thrush--\n\n--this when he found himself wandering out of doors on a bleak winter day.  And he heard the thrush singing:  \n\n                   \"So little cause for carolings\n                          Of such ecstatic sound\n                     Was written on terrestrial things\n                          Afar or nigh around\n                      That I could think there trembled through\n                           His happy good-night air\n                      Some blessed hope whereof he knew\n                           And I was unaware.\" \n\n\"Some blessed hope--\"  Precisely.  Hardy had given up the Christian faith of his youth.  Oh no, he must have exclaimed!

Who, for instance is the lone woman standing at the right of the painting who turns out to be the actual focal point.\n\nI wonder if the bleakness we see is because that's what we're focused on?\n\nI share the author's age and I keep thinking of the issue of suicide that Camus approached in the 1940's Hitler was invincible and Trump may be inevitable, and the relief of older people is that we may not live long enough to have to endure Trump.  It's not suicide but not having to live with him appears to be a soothing end.\n\nCamus said suicide was not an option--Hitler wasn't invincible and the polls are no longer reliable.\n\nI think there is optimism in Monet's painting.",

The darkness provides me cover both literally and symbolically, the quiet and the solitude my port in a storm.\n\nAnd two, for being as far removed from my reverse seasonal affective disorder as it is possible to be.

        "It's not a spilling light, but it does seem as if this is a memory through a window of drifts and the smell of burning wood. There is a determination and a trudging. There is a seeking wonder. There is  a sadness in a lingering haze. These people in the snow do not appear to be the workers. No horses have walked through here, or there are no hoof prints of them. This is a 19th-Century painting, but the architecture implies that the buildings themselves are perhaps from the 16th-Century, and one might be a church. I am not convinced the daylight goes too fast, like life, it just goes and then there is the dark. The poetry of the painting is a seeing in the dark. I wonder if the figures of human images ever made it home. I wonder where they live and if their lives, living in this space, were worth it. Who says a man cannot wear a dress. Or he/she could be the vicar or a priest. We come to it with all of our prejudices intact. The building on the left is a hotel. No one is sledding down the hills on the left. There is a clown in the middle of the painting. The clown is playing in what are ruins. Not unlike our lives today. We are the ruinous species and something in our guts and the buried flash backs, are coordinated filtering with just a touch of dread. We dread our earth. We dread our air of coal. We dread what waits for us as soon as we open the back screen door. Hats and boots. Not wealthy enough for carriages. I suggest tongues of whispering, the snow is moving right.",

I\u2019ve experienced many, but not all, of the things you relate here, and it\u2019s wonderful to think that others have found this comfort and joy.  Last winter was so rainy and dark here in California.  Sometimes after the rain stopped, but it was still thoroughly overcast, the view of the ridge on the other side of our little valley might unexpectedly brighten, I guess from a thinning of clouds I couldn\u2019t directly see.  That lifted my spirits.  I called it magic light, and I looked forward to it.  It didn\u2019t happen very often, but I surely cherish the memory.

        "All good stuff. My only question is why do we frame our western culture with Buddhism?\n\nI have no problem with eastern thought. My uncle was a zen abbot and I've done tai chi for 40 years. I also throw the I Ching daily.\n\nOne thought keeps coming up though: what in the western mind am I trying to escape? The answer for me is pathology.\n\nPathology is calling me through dark moods. The magic in the western tradition is cloaked in darkness, in order to find it you have to be willing to face the dark forest, the path that peters out when the bread crumbs are gone.\n\nSome of this is in eastern thought too, but as a westerner I must not push away the ghouls, monsters, golems, coyotes, hags and cyclops of my culture that go back all the way to Homer and Heraclitus.\n\nIn fact try reading Heraclitus today, put aside that DT Suzuki and that T.N. Hanh. Ready the last chapter of the Odyssey, not some sutra from a Tibetan tradition you have no connection to. \n\nFor example have you familiarized yourself with the Reformation and Counter-Reformation?  There is much to be gained in working through how that passage affected our psyche that cannot be found in Basho.\n\nOn the other hand if you are a Tibetan or Chinese monk - and I know a couple - please continue to do your work. Just don't ask me to abandon my precious pathological culture, because that is what forms the basis of my psyche. \n\nThere are many gifts in the darkness, in the nigredo as alchemy labels that precious state of black moods.",

        "No, we should not so reflexively equate light with what we seek or like and dark with all to avoid or dislike. Time is time, however light or dark, and we can fruitfully experience our human nature in either. Light gets overly glorified and associated the affirmative while dark gets all the bad raps. Upon reflection, which we can equally well explore in any hue, one might just as often come to inner peace, joy, and contentment in relative darkness as in the lighter shades. Opening to the possibilities and realities of who we are is not contingent upon anything except being open to oneself and the world in which one lives, right here, right now. Just breathe deeply and you'll get it.",
        "Oh, thank you, Dr. Pipher, for this beautiful and poignant reminder that we really do not need to look too far to see the light of hope and joy.  I must admit that these dark days of winter can bring me down.  I think of my recently passed on husband and my deceased parents.  In and of themselves, they were lights of love while on this earth.  Yet, their lights still shine upon and within my grown children, my family which remains, my friends.  And it is because of that, that my own light of hope and faith transcends the losses, grief, and fears we all must journey through.  After reading this essay, I looked out my window and saw birds flitting around trees which have lost their leaves but represent rebirth in the spring.  I see the mountains and hills in our little valley, indeed an idyllic reality.  In my bookcase, I see Doerr's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, All The Light We Cannot See, beautifully written prose that tells us:  Look, just look.  There is still so much to live for.",

        "Thank you for this beautifully written meditation on finding light in these dark times. \n\nDuring these dark days sounds and particularly music seem even more powerful.

I love nature, but will linger in the aisles of the lighting department at stores soaking in the light at this time of year.\n\nI am reminded of the MLK quote during these dark times.\n\n\"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.

        "There is a reason why the most technologically advanced industrial nations are situated in colder climes; cold, harsh, inhospitable and inclement weather mentally focuses one on the urgency of doing what needs to be done now in order to survive, whereas living in perpetually sunny, tropical, equatorial climes can inure one into thinking that life is good and that one should be free, joyful, and carefree, an attitude that is inconducive to the hard and grueling work of economic progress and industrial mobilization.  The realization that one needs to drag oneself out of bed to shovel the driveway on a frigid morning just to earn one's keep instills a work ethic that rolling out of bed on a beachfront villa in temperate zones cannot.\n\nThe diminishing window of daylight in winter makes time more precious, just as the twilight of one's years induces us to esteem our remaining time on this earth more dearly.  Ideally our winter selves would inform our summer selves to use our more ample time in summer months to greater profit; likewise, one hopes, our society will do a better job at allowing our fellow Americans in their twilight years greater interaction with younger Ameticans in the spring of their prime that they may profit from the wisdom of experience, to save decades of time finding out for themselves what the previous generation already has, and to take enormous shortcuts in life by leveraging one's youth informed by the lessons of those who have trodden the path before them",

The grayness often comes as early as October, and does not let up until mid to late February when the days grow noticeably longer - making February one of my favorite months.  The reason for this grayness is almost entirely geographical, but I would never trade the geographical feature that brings all of the low gray.  Nor would I ever move to a warm, sunny location; those parts of the country where the inhabitants proudly announce that they hate snow.   So when I read Mary Pipher's op-ed, I looked at this morning's gray sky and felt good about it.   It's where I live.",

At the same time, they have learned to cope with it, and they go out and enjoy the season. Children play at the playgrounds in the darkness, and its fine since it only 3pm..

For us that means health, no debt, stable income and VERY good weed.  We are grateful.  Watching the later arrivals struggle, and knowing the slope is bending further down the lifestyle axis, we are sympathetic.  But we are not going to lower the thermostat.  Sorry.",
        "beautifully written.  and I feel it all from your essay even though you are away up North and I am in North Florida.  the. family, the friends, the true light, the birds that come through.  truly we are blessed as so many don't seem to be.  but we can pray for the dispossessed  and for all those caught in wars in the Middle East and the Ukraine !  our. prayers will be heard!  thank you!",
        "Thank you. A reminder humankind has always sought the light even in the darkest winters because we are, at heart, creatures of light. As Joni Mitchell famously wrote \"We are stardust, we are golden\" and unfortunately in these fraught times of war when old man again toss away the lives of the next generation, \"caught in the Devil's bargain\"...",
        "As I was scanning the Times for the news of the day, my eye was drawn to this side piece glowing through the darkness.\nJust as Rembrandt so beautifully presented light, Dr. Pipher has done so, and I am grateful.",
        "When I look at the darkness that swept the world during World War 2, I find it remarkable that society survived -- that after such a conflagration, civility triumphed, and a cooperative world of trade and interconnectedness managed to thrive.\n\nOr, for example, the surprise of the new birth of the Renaissance that blossomed after the Black Plague.  The world has been through exceedingly dark times, and many generations have suffered through them to get us here.  Each era faces its challenges, and it only takes a few beacons of light to lead us out of the darkness.\n\n\"We cannot stop all the destruction\" but we can work against it, and resist it.  Each day, the sun rises, and we are given one more chance to stand in the light, and to try again -- and eventually, some of us are going to get it right, and point the way out of the pit.\n\nDr. Pipher's essay here is a good start for getting us there -- and for that, I offer my thanks.  And it is more than wishful thinking when I say, may Peace prevail.",
        "Wonderful essay.  I've lately gotten into the habit of rising before dawn... something I used to think was ghastly, but now I almost need it as it is such a reassuring thing to see the light slowly rise and replace the darkness.",
        "Beautiful!  I try to keep a cadence of positive light flowing in and out of my life.  I try to uplift others, especially this time of year.  Turning off TV helps, except for comedy and art.  Patience is key, and being kind to oneself.  I also meditate and paint, and read a lot, and shoot target archery.  Namaste.",
        "so beautifully said, your essay made me weep.  thank you.",
        "\"For other kinds of light...\"\n\nPerhaps the guiding thread linking all kinds of light, from the morning light to a spoken word to a flash of eyes: the process of coming into being and pass out of being. \n\nAnd then the imperative: don't miss it, but - also - don't hold on too tightly. \n\nIn every instance of light, that was your entire life, too: emerging and disappearing. But disappearing as a necessary moment for maintaining an openness to all \"other kinds of light.\"\n\n(Re-read this piece: you'll notice perhaps one instance of political, national, or ethnic identity...and not even in a politicized manner. I wonder why. Perhaps because identity is the fiction standing in the way of the ethical regard for fleeting life.)",
        "Beautiful and timely for sure.. I  unexpectedly shed some tears while reading this.   . Does one tune out of the news cycle.. The Puzzle section is my quick go-to after a brief   skim of the horrors of the day here in the Times.  ... I was drawn to this article by the  Monet in winter illustration...... Painting outdoors has been my few moments of looking for the light ,.....  Thank you so much for the reminders!!",
        "Thank you for this lovely essay. It\u2019s a much needed reminder to seek out light this time of year",
        "Very beautiful reflection.  Thank you.\n\nLast year, at this time of year, I wrote a poem on your same themes.  Here it is.\n\nLate December\n\nThe shadows are long,\nStretching way out before me\nI am standing in the middle of the woods\nThe only sounds are those of winter\nThe hush of clumps of snow\nFalling off of limbs\nInto more snow\n\nThe muted light\nFrom the sun beneath the tree-line\nAn occasional cardinal \nColoring the almost darkness\n\nWe will tilt some more into space \nand prepare for a pause\nThen tilt the other way\n\nI will tilt and pause toward my children\nIn the new year\nI will lean toward them and listen\nTheir all-kinds-of-words scattering darkness\nLike soundwaves or even light",
        "Thank you for a beautiful meditation.  I will carry this with me today and hopefully for many days.  I feel better already.",
        "This is so beautifully written. It is indeed true that the world seems a dark and chaotic place these days \u2014 but when has that not been the case? It\u2019s helpful to remember that there are always sources of light that we can access, as the author so eloquently describes. Thank you for your uplifting insights.",
        "'Already, she can bring me a picture book and read \u201cwhale,\u201d \u201cporpoise\u201d and \u201csquid\u201d in a voice that reminds me of sleigh bells.' \n\nWhat a beautiful, poetic line!  \n\nAnd an entire beautiful, poetic essay. Thank you for this.",
        "Thank you very much for your poignant words. Your words are much needed for me and many others on this cold December morning.",
        "Beautiful, timely, and so appreciated. Thank you!!"
