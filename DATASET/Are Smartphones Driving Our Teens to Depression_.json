        "Having followed Haidt's work for some time, I find his thesis compelling. But what concerns me most about the \"thoughtful\" critics is how they seem to need for Haidt to be wrong. Can we really ignore the evidence of our eyes? Kids are less social IRL. The species evolved for contact, real contact to survive. Less time with friends. Less sex. Schools more dysfunctional. Look around you.\n\nI wonder what the advantage is to ignore even inconsistent signs of a variety of problems. Here is my current working theory. Younger parents are also addicted to their phones. To conceed that their kids are caught in a social media trap would mean they have to look at their own habits. To ask their children to put down their phones exposes their own addition. Grasping at any writers countering Haidt's thesis lowers the anxiety of the adults that they screwed up by handing their todlers an iPad babysitter. \n\nMostly I wonder why take the chance social media is harming kids. Reports I see from schools that ban phones all seem to say everything changes for the better. Kids start being kids again. So, what's the harm in trying Haidt's suggestions? What if the change makes kid's lives better, richer and more balanced? What are we phone addicted adults avoiding?",

        "It is difficult to come away from Haidt's book and not be alarmed. And of course, it is natural to question his interpretation of the data. I am a behavioural researcher who often gets the opportunity to talk to practitioners of different stripes and whenever I mention the issue of social media, everyone has many stories to tell about psychiatric wards being overwhelmed, increases in depression, anxiety and suicidality, as well as other odd behaviours, encouraged on social media encouraged \"communities\". It is true that it is difficult to draw absolute causal inferences from all the data. But really, shouldn't we be careful? The same was said about the smoking - cancer association for much of its history. It is difficult to draw causal inferences in the social sciences. But shouldn't we be careful? Wouldn't it be best to use a little judgement and check things out before having everything available to everyone anytime, any place, any way? The data are compelling. The studies require our attention. Meanwhile, social media is going unchecked.",
        "Geez. \nReading this made me think I'm getting dementia. \nI can't keep track from one paragraph to the next, with studies and assumptions and results all over the place. \n\nIs that the point of the piece? \n\nI think I learned this: \nMaybe our teens are in trouble, we don't know. We don't have reliable information because we haven't done the right studies in the right places with the right methodology. Maybe smart phones - or social media (I'm not clear on that either) - are ruining young people and society, but maybe not. We have no idea.\n\nI am apparently not the intended audience.  \nOr, perhaps it really is true that my cognition is just not as sharp as it once was and I am unable to synthesize complex data. \nSigh.",
        "Sometimes you have to use your common sense. Most people feel that phones make them  feel worse. For me, a good day is a day when I don't use the phone, and I don't even use social media. If phones hurt adults so much, it is quite likely that youngsters whose brains are still developing would be hurt even more.\n\nIt takes about 30 years for smoking to cause lung cancer and not every smoker gets it. So phones would have to be several orders of magnitude worse than smoking for its effects to be measurable in less than 17 years. It took many years to prove beyond reasonable doubt that smoking causes cancer. It will take even more to determine what damage phones are doing to people. For the time being, I'll keep staying away from my phone and making sure my kids don't use one.",

        "A smart phone is just the doorway to the internet and all it has to offer, both good and bad. I can research something now in 15 minutes that used to cause me a trip to the library and hours of reading. I can watch a how-to video and easily fix my car saving lots of money. Or, I can watch and read about how I look, pray, live, who I like, etc. is all wrong and how I am a total reject and failure. The challenge is how do we use this tool for the best it does, not the worst?",
        "What do young people actually learn from their phones? Not much, it seems. Or at least, not much that is deemed serious, weighty or important. It is the transience and ephemeralness of the teen phone experience that I find so troubling, not to mention the sheer vacuity of a lot of social media. It would leave me feeling hollow.\n\nI remember standing on a crowded train behind a young person scrolling through her phone for a good half hour. Without wanting to, I could see the content and was shocked by the inanity of what she was looking at.",
        "A very good story on the complexities of the issue.  It reports an important fact.  Suicide rate in teenagers may be on the rise but it is parallel to suicide rate increases in older groups.  The simultaneous increases point to another more general factor.",
        "We'll never know given how much lobbying hush money Big Tech pays legislators. \n\nAs I type this, I'm sure my phone is memorializing it in such a way that the info will be bundled and sold to advertisers in an effort to once again monetize private information without informed \u2013 or frankly \u2013 any consent.  Then fed into an algorithmic loop designed to further entrap.  \n\nOur privacy laws are the issue here.  By which I mean our huge lack thereof. \n\nWant radical change?  You go straight to the source.  That means essentially government takeover of social media orgs like X and Meta.  They're basically already funneling that info over and censoring things as is so this is just removing the profiteering middleman (Musk, Zuckerburg).  Who add what exactly anyway.

        "It isn't the smartphones themselves, but what runs on them, so-called \"social media\".\n\nWhen all you see are the highlights of multiple other people's lives, and compare that to how you're life is, what's not to get depressed over?  How fulfilling and gratifying is a screen-depth only text message (with emoties) compared to seeing seeing your friend laugh and feeling their warm touch?\n\nAny parent that cares will NOT give their teen a smartphone, or allow them to buy one.  The \"All my friends...\" argument is bankrupt.",

Even when\nthe mother turned up later, the girl was never aware that anything had gone amiss.\nHow are young people going to learn how to socialize, or even\nto respond to what's going on around them, if they are \nso distracted?  It is no wonder that such intrusions, that undermine the basic psychological needs of humans, are causing alienation and depression.",

I'm the parent of a 21 year old and saw the worst when she started transitioning to adulthood, I would blame mostly the peer pressures of chat apps, but the great number of \"influencers\" each with their own truth have also contributed.  \nA relative with a 5 year old has gone to the extreme of keeping the child isolated from smartphones, no one is even allowed to show family photos, we all believe it's creating a worst problem, but there seems to be no easy or logical solution.",

        "I think the key is this: think about when we ( generation x) watched shows like The Brady Bunch and The Cosby Show.  We envied them we wanted to be like them.  Now picture watching one show 24 hours a day starring your friends and family, mediated by an engagement algorithm that rewards anger,  extremism, bragging, and mob mentality.  All of our social media relationships are sponsored by the Meta corporation, and the like and retweet reactions are carefully meted out by a behaviorist variable ratio schedule to keep you engaged and enraged.  Is there any doubt that this is affecting our real life relationships?  Just like we didn\u2019t know the difference between real life and The Brady Bunch or Different Strokes(or didn\u2019t want to), they aren\u2019t or don\u2019t want to either.  Kids are innocently unaware of the manipulations of the real world. It\u2019s monkey see, monkey do.  A dream for advertisers, social engineers, and propagandists. Haidt\u2019s book exposes all of this.  We all felt it, he put into words, brilliantly.  More correlating research is coming.  And let\u2019s face it: When we talk about \u201cworrying about the children\u201d, we\u2019re really talking about ourselves.",
        "There is another loss that I have noticed by observation over time.  Attention spans are shortening because we all have a little distraction box in our pockets that is full of extremely engaging and marvelous and largely disconnected things.  Everyday reality has a hard time competing.  Learning is affected in both its quality and quantity.  An in-class experiment that twenty years ago brought stares of wonder now receives mostly muted responses.  Tolerance for uncertainty, for reflection, for persistent thought on a single topic are all diminishing.  This focus problem is as systemic as the social problem, and of course the two are related and feed off each other.  These issues are going to get more intense with the rise of AI.  Our students, and education in general, are in real trouble.",
        "Image this scenario. Put 25 people, young and old in any American airport boarding gate, for 45 minutes without a digital device and watch what happens. After only 20 minutes you would witness: Psychological distress, cravings, restlessness, fidgeting, nervous tension, and uncomfortability. After 45 min you would witness significant agitation and some emotional disturbances. Think about 25 people, for 1.5 hours waiting for a plane at the airport boarding gate without a cellphone stimulus. In 2024, many people would simply find the experience unbearable. The nail biting would start after only 20 minutes. We are a culture of constant stimulation. The cellphone has become to our brains, a baby safety blanket. Our brains have become more and more attached to the stimulus responses that cellphones provide.  \nThe average teenager spends 7.5 hours day on digital entertainment media. That doesn't mean learning about the Apollo space missions, the temperature of freezing water and the jurassic period. That means 7.5 hours a day on being digitally entertained. They don't want to play in nature and build a bug jar. They can't manage boredom without having anxiety and panic attacks. They \"sit\" on average for 7.5 hours a day in front of screens being entertained. Sitting is the new smoking. A mental health impact, most certainly yes.",

        "Haidt\u2019s claims may be overstated, but the skeptical arguments are methodologically flawed, as presented here.   Skeptics appear to insist that if it\u2019s a causal relationship, it\u2019s generalizable apart from place, culture, and class.  It\u2019s a very narrow approach to causality in human affairs that makes it possible to set aside as unverified  what thousands of parents, teachers, and psychiatrists have observed over the years in this time, in places like ours.",

But as someone who has been teaching college students for more than three decades (and watched my child grow up on the first two decades of this millennium), I would say that any serious qualitative observation of preteens, teens, and young adults tells you that things have changed due to the cell phone & the internet that have seriously damaged what were the fragile joys of childhood.",
        "In the developing world, where I live, smart phones have helped connect people in ways previously impossible -- families with their kids who have moved to the cities, isolated communities with regional health centers, disaster zones with national crisis centers, etc.\n\nIf you ask these people whether phones have improved their lives, you will find near unanimity that they have. \n\nPhones have no place in the classroom, absolutely.  But the near-universal condemnation of phones in general seems to me to reflect an American myopia that the writer rightly questions.",

        "Maybe the phones aren't the root cause of all depression for teens, but what about the next generation?\n\nI'm an elementary school teacher and I can definitely say, as can my peers who have been teaching for more than 20 years like myself, is that the little kids are not ok.  Sure the pandemic upended things, but now we've got elementary school kids who weren't in school yet when the pandemic started.  For many of these kids the phone/tablet has been an endless source of stimulation handed to them by busy parents with no limitations.  \n\nWe are now seeing young kids who have fewer social skills, less patience, less stamina for learning, than ever.  Really.  I can document it by looking at past students' work.  The work from 15 years ago still has beautiful drawing and thoughtful creativity.  If you put it side by side with the work of today's kids the difference is stark. The drawings are minimal, the explanations are lacking, and the lack of effort is apparent in the lack of use of space on paper.\n\nSo, maybe today's teens' mental health is not being completely determined by excessive use of phones and tablets.  But many more young kids' brains are being changed in a more profound way.\n\nWonder what the depression and suicide stats will look like for teens in 2035.",

Much better, seemingly, than Haidt\u2019s book-length treatment; I heard Haidt interviewed on Ezra Klein and Haidt\u2019s data is obviously garbage, you can tell by the way he tries to defend it. \n\nBut the reason the smartphone hypothesis is so easy to accept is because we have all had this experience. We all know phones are making our minds worse, that we feel worse the more consistently we are spending 4-8 hours a day looking at our phones with hardly a holiday from it.  It isn\u2019t hard to extrapolate our own feelings of increased anxiety from smartphone use to what it must be like as a young person still trying to sort things out. \n\nSmartphones are bad. They are bad. Their convenience is not worth the price but now society is so integrated with them that it is hard to let them go. I don\u2019t know what the answer is here for any of us but it is utterly absurd to believe that smartphones are not the cause of at least some mental health problems in both teens and adults.",

        "Is it any surprise what these tech monstrosities are doing when they are developed by autistic sociopaths intent upon exploiting every form of human frailty? But it is deeper than that. Virtually everyone in public life accepts the same set of preposterous beliefs. That economic growth can continue indefinitely on a finite planet; that the unhindered acquisition of enormous fortunes by a few is acceptable, even commendable; that they should be allowed to own as much natural wealth as their money can buy no matter what damage is done; that there\u2019s nothing objectionable about a few billionaires setting the political agenda; and that anyone who disputes such notions has no place in civil society. There is absolutely no way we can deal with the ongoing climate crisis or the daily desecration of the young without an economy directed on behalf of the our own species and the others with whom we share the planet. The so called free market recognises only two types of human value, net worth and target market. It is predator and prey writ large. A harsher regime is hard to imagine, yet it plunges onward globally with the release of new technologies totally untested for their impact, particularly on the young. Equipping every kid with a video camera, access to porn and a means of dissemination was a very bad idea, soul destroying actually. Who knows what Artificial Intelligence will bring? No one. And what a joke that term is; Mass Data Manipulation by Sociopaths is far more accurate.",
        "While I have no doubt that smart phones are a disaster, the data I've seen is that the leading cause of depression in teenagers is a lack of control over their own lives.  In fact, it was written up here in the Times several months ago.\n\nParents, running their children's lives, top to bottom, are leaving them with a feeling of helplessness.  Yes, you aren't helping your child through life, you are making them unhappy as all get out.  \n\nBy the time a young person is a teenager, they should be learning to make decisions.  They should be learning how to run their own lives.  Instead, Mommy and Daddy are running the show.  I'd be depressed too.",

I got my phone at the ripe old age of 13, and mostly use it to play video games. I love video games. It is a way for me to connect with friends and improve my skill, and engage in a story and community. Social media, while it can be a terrible thing, can also help. Moderation is key. You can balance a healthy screen time, like I (and some of my peers) do. Getting straight A's and still having time to watch YouTube is absolutely possible.\nThere is also a lot of education about screen time (at least in my schools) and the bad things that come with social media and making friends online.\nSmartphones are here to stay. I grew up with them, it is all I know. It is fascinating and dangerous at the same time. Please just use your tech responsibly, and you will feel so much better mentally!",
        "It's not the phones. The phones have gotten a completely bad rap. There are negative aspects of course, and really huge positive ones! No one mentions how young people can connect with each other any time of the day now. Get a reality check, a verbal hug or advice from a friend. They want info on STD's, how to plan a cross country trip, or what career choices exist in the arts? They got it at their fingertips! Compare that to my era, where kids were alone ( except in a regimented school), lonely, and many of us did not have the means ,( 1 car  and 1 phone families) to talk with our peers openly, which was still stifled because many subjects were taboo. \nIt's exactly what the article states, a complex convergence of many factors- including the lost stigma in reporting issues and problems as teens. I live in a 3 generation household. I work with people in their early twenties. I really think the improved communications offer  a better place, not easier, but better as they get to make a lot of their own choices and access information they want in today's internet world. No more being handed down approved and sometimes severely edited info from an older generation as we were. I think they will do fine, and the elders need to back off.",

        "I can't speak to teens, but I will say that my own anxiety increased, and happiness decreased, in the years after I got my smartphone.  Previously, I had been a light user of social media, and used the internet only at certain times of the day.  Once I got my smart phone, though, I found myself obsessively checking social media, the news, my email.\n\nI was 24-7 inundated by terrible things happening in the news.  I would be deeply offended by something a friend-of-a-friend posted online.  My attention was constantly interrupted by pings and alerts.  I only read articles, and stopped reading books--I lost my attention span!  I also had my first anxiety attack at the age of 41.\n\nA year ago, I finally deleted all distracting apps.  My smartphone is now simply a utilitarian tool, not an entertainment device.   I use it when I need to check the weather or get directions, but otherwise it's put away.\n\nMy happiness immediately increased.  No more anxiety.  I read books again!\n\nSo, I don't really care about what the data say.  I absolutely believe, that at least for some people, smartphones contributed to poorer mental health.",

I have no scientific evidence to support my theory, but at 74, I'm old enough to remember what this country and its people were like before we entered the Cyber World that most people live in today. The devices we use constantly were designed to be highly addictive. They have re-wired or brains in a dramatic fashion, erasing the past so that we all live in the anxious NOW... all the time. Silence and reflection seem to have become obsolete. We are on hyper alert all the time, and we react without thought or reflection. The devices have almost severed whatever pathetic connection we  still had to Nature as recently as 15 or 20 years ago. The machines and the robots are taking over, and we are LETTING THEM!  The corporate world, especially Silicon Valley, are the main drivers in this de-humanizing process. They want to turn us all into docile, malleable consumers, who buy on impulse, and spend, spend, spend.",
        "Dear Mr. Wallace-Wells,\n\nAs a layman, I can speak not to depression but to the generalized heightened dysfunction of most everyone in our culture in recent years, and I'm quite convinced Arthur Schopenhauer and his \"On Noise\" essay has both the definitive and indeed the last word on the question - the mind needs SILENCE in order to function properly, and now for too many folks there is simply not a minute in their day without a phone scrambling their brains in one way or another.\n\nCordially",
        "Well yeah.  It\u2019s completely obvious.  The Zuckerberg generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs all rallied around this one idea to make money online:\n\n\u201cHow do we convince billions of people to use a new product that they don\u2019t need, that nobody asked for, get them addicted to it, and then sell their personal information to anyone willing to pay for influence?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like cigarettes, but at least Big Tobacco stops at getting us hooked to the product.  The double whammy of luring people into a habit and violating their privacy and influencing their minds\u2026 is just absurdly disgusting.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved tech and the internet\u2026 spent so much time online growing up.  It wasn\u2019t good for me.  And I remember so vividly how much worse and how much creepier everything online got between 2010 and 2016\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget it or let anyone tell me otherwise.  I remember the ardent denial and mental gymnastics people did, too, to justify these toxic social media platforms that were producing massive capital gains.",

        "Finally the Times presents an article which shows the cherry picking and over blown studies and books by Haidt and Twenge. There are many other studies and reviews of their work out there that have shown the same thing. For example see see Livingstone, Cavanaugh and Corsaro.  When Haidt is not overstating things he also tries to take credit for things like children need more time for play and social agency that Corsaro and others have documented for over 20 years.  From some of the comments here though it is clear that many buy in to this social media and cell phones as a clear cause of mental health problems for teens argument and do not want to hear any problems with this argument.  Good social scientists do not cherry pick but even look for counter evidence to their hypotheses.  In the meantime Haidt and Twenge laugh all the way to the bank with their books and talks and use of social media themselves to plug their work.",

They saw it, I saw it, parents saw it.",
        "This column grew on me as I read through it, but still, I'm constantly surprised by the committed skepticism of many pundits. The problem is so literally right in front of our faces, for so many hours both day and night. Agreed, no data story will be perfect and no social phenomenon can be easily reduced to a single cause or easy explanation. But don't we all know by now that spending all day on a screen, fed by the attention economy, makes us less happy, and if there are measurable correlations with youth unhappiness in so many areas of the data, isn't it fair to draw some causal conclusions and respond accordingly?\n\nThe review in Nature was overstated and irresponsible. The magazine discredits itself when it makes such unsophisticated proclamations about 'science says.'",
        "This is a complex social issue. Without standardized tests rigorously conducted and monitored, all results are bound to be skewed or meaningless. One might as well just speculate and move on -- to somewhere.\n\nI wonder how much influence on young people's mental health the widespread revelation of political corruption at the very highest levels, worldwide, may have. People use their phones now to find out about wrongdoing of those we're supposed to trust. And to complicate things, they also get misinformed, intentionally, by bad actors along the way.\n\nIf I were young, I think I'd be very, very upset and depressed.",
        "As someone who has spent the last twenty years with teenagers, I'll say this. When the phones are away, the students talk more, play more, smile more. It's not just what the phones do, it's what the student don't do in that five hours a day. \n\nAnother thought: it is hard to be a teen in the US. Ask any exchange student. Unless you have a car, it's hard to get around. Our cities are not built to sustain a high quality of life for any of us, but teenagers really suffer from this. Maybe they wouldn't look at their phones so much if it was easier to move around our cities and suburbs so they could hang out with their friends.",
        "Smartphones and social media are merely two facets of our ongoing and increasing alienation from the natural world which began in earnest in the nineteenth century and has been gathering pace every since.  We are, no news here, animals who evolved in intimate connection with the animals and plants which surrounded us and in the presence of the rhythms of the planet.  For the vast majority of humanity, those connection have been almost completely severed, first by the advent of mechanical devices to spare us from physical exertion, latterly by electronic technology which spares us the necessity of reflective thought and endlessly diverts our attention from our immediate physical environment.  It's hard to imagine how we would not end up seriously psychically disturbed, given the circumstances.",
        "I think there is an instinct among liberals (myself included) to try and find holes in Haidt's argument because he's harnessed a few ideas appealing to conservatives.  But on this point, arguments against his broad thesis just don't pass the smell test.  If you have kids, especially teenage girls, you can see this is clearly happening.  Sure, nitpick studies if you want, but his overall research is sound and his articulation of the root issues are well stated.  And to hint that maybe \"this isn't really happening\" appears to be more of a game to discredit someone than it is to explore this truly pressing issue in good faith.  I hope we don't get lost trying to stay aligned with the \"right side\" on this topic at the destruction of a generation.",

        "Are smartphone driving teens to depression?\n\nYes. As a father of two teens I can attest it's not just social media apps that are a problem. It's the phone itself. It's the substitution of real, live conversations with other humans for pictures on a screen.",
        "It really is striking to walk into most high schools today during lunch. A decade ago kids were talking to each other and hanging out. There is still some of that but so much of what you see is table after table of kids staring at their devices. Either watching/playing something on a laptop or mindlessly scrolling through a phone. Sometimes it'll be a whole table of eight or ten kids and none of them even look at each other. I'd be depressed too",
        "The beginning of this crisis go back way before smart phones.  If we want to go to the true roots, to the idea that make up was needed to make women more desirable.  Move forward through the various eras of women's magazines, then when teen and pre-teen magazines came into being things started to accelerate.  They pitched the idea that not only was make up required but so were all the accessories, hair, clothes, shoes, bangles, on and on needed.  The the converse came into play, that if you Didn't have these things you were a loser and would never amount to anything other than a kitchen drudge.\n\nSmart phones were an accelerate that sped up the entire pitch and made it portable.  They also made it possible to take a selfie and do a side by side comparison with the latest \"It\" girl to see just how much of a loser you really are.  So the epidemic of \"Cutting\" and self harm is also accelerated.\n\nWhat is needed is training beginning  in the pre-teen range on self worth for girls.  It must be taught by women to young women and continue through their teenage year and into early adulthood.  Guys can't be involved in this.  We don't have the language, the emotional skills, or the credibility, to do this work.   I expect there will be huge push back from the beauty & lifestyle industry, because this calls into question their reason for being.",
        "From the article: \"Lives are far too complex to easily reduce to the influence of single factors, whether the factor is a recession or political conditions or, for that matter, climate breakdown.\"\n\nThe latter is often overlooked in discussions of teenage depression, but it is a growing reason because those paying attention see too little being done too late. For a young person who will live to see things get very bad the future is realistically looking quite grim indeed.",

        "A thousand times yes. As an educator, especially post pandemic, I am horrified by the lack of social interaction these students experience. It's too tempting to opt-out, leading many to extreme anxiety and depression. When I was young we had to problem solve social situations. Our students don't have the opportunities to learn these skills like they used to. As a Gen-Xer, I actually feel very grateful that I did not grow up with a cell phone. To be honest, I feel so bad for these young people. It's a cruel responsibility to throw on them. No one under 16 should be touching them.",
        "As a tech executive for a leading smart phone company, I want to say that I completely agree with what Mr. Wallace has pointed out in this brilliant and insightful essay. Smart phones are not to blame for the dire straights of young people, in fact young people would be better off being on their phones more, not less, that is what our studies suggest.\n\nWe are currently developing tools and apps, that are extremely cost competitive, where young people can self diagnose and treat their depression and anxiety, without ever bothering their parents or seeing a doctor. Soon young people will never have to interact with anyone in person ever again, this will give parents great piece of mind because we know how dangerous and scary the world can be.\n\nTrust us we have the best interests of young people in mind.",
        "Thank you for this excellent and much needed article. As a resercher in psychology and biology I appreciate your critical approach and careful analysis of the data. Haidt's hypothesis has always been too facile, and glosses over the obvious inconsistencies that you document so well. Phones can't explain all, most, or perhaps even much of a complex issue like mental health in adolescents. Haidt has gained much attention for pushing this seemingly simple means of reducing anxiety and isolation in teens, and both parents and politicians have seized on his claims as a quick fix that allows them to avoid dealing with the much more complex suite of contributing etiology. What invest public funds into a robust mental healthcare system when you can just tell parents to take their kids' phones away. Haidt's advocacy may just seem like another ambitious academic seeking attention, but it has the insidious effect of enabling policy makers to avoid dealing with the complex reality of mental health.

        "While this data is deeply concerning, the consequences extend far beyond teen mental health. Connecting every person to the Internet at all times is causing all of our major institutions to break down. They were not designed to tolerate instant global human connectivity. \n\nBig changes are famously said to happen \"slowly at first, then all at once.\" We're still in the \"slowly at first\" period, watching governments, communities, families, education systems, relationships, infrastructure, mental health, etc. come apart due to the effects of the mobile Internet. \n\nPonder for a moment how many trillions of collective human hours have been poured into the black hole of social media, with nothing lasting to show for it. Imagine if a fraction of those hours had been spent building communities, volunteering, learning skills, raising families, or simply spending time with others. \n\nIn the coming decades, we'll experience the \"all at once\" collapse of our institutions. Optimistically, perhaps what replaces them will be superior! New institutions designed to enrich our globally connected humanity.

        "What prompted the Obama administration to recommend and cover annual depression screening for teenage girls in 2011?\n\nAlso, \"phones\" and \"social media\" are two distinct things that seem to be conflated in this analysis.\n\nAnd the studies seem to treat the content displayed on phones by social media as a constant, like television, where everyone sees the same news and commercials. That's simply not the case with \"personalized\" social media, where literally everyone can see different content, making it an unknowable variable. \n\nThis becomes even more important when comparing data across countries, because the teenagers may use the same iPhone in the US, France, and Norway, but the social media algorithm in each country could be significantly different, depending on what drives engagement, as well as regulations.\n\nNot meant as a criticism of an author that I respect, but articles like this, with its abundance of data of seemingly widely varying quality, as well as Tom Edsall's columns that seem to increasingly be replete with contradictory data, can only lead one to question the value of \"data\" and \"experts\". \n\nCombined with the mounting evidence of the mistakes that the \"experts\" made in the Covid response, it's very difficult to take \"listen to the science\" seriously anymore. \n\n\"Science\" is now reaching parity with economics, where nobody trusts economists anymore, because they unabashedly use economic \"data\" for blatantly political purposes. \n\nAnd that's extremely disturbing.",

        "A lot of statistics here, data, etc. In my own view, I think that  young  girls and boys are more anxious and fearful because of several things: [1] First, they have been out of school at home, or wherever, in 2020-2022, maybe even 2023, due to the pandemic. they didn't socialize much, lagged behind in their intellectual development, spent probably too much time on their phones. Many did not feel safe or secure. [2] Over-reliance on cell-phone use. Max Fisher writes well about the unregulated use of social media in his book, The Chaos Machine. Much that is on social media is hyperbole, emotional outbursts, i.e., language that raises people's anxiety levels. Adults try to manage their obsessions on their phones; Adolescents, not so much. There are some awful things on their phones.\n\nI would also add that the general atmosphere created by Trump - bad language; emotional charges; verbal attacks - do not help lessen the emotional climate.  Hid words are broadcast in print and online media.\n\nFor adolescents to mature, they need a great deal of social interaction with peers and adults. They need to be able to think, make decisions, talk over issues with mentors, teachers, parents. Doing so means that they have to spend less time on their phones. They need support. After all, they are the future.",

I know so many adults who talk about their own social media addictions, and who admit it's a net negative in their lives, but it's difficult to quit.  I know a lot of adults that feel embarrassed by the amount of time they spend on their phones, much of it wasted time doing mindless things.\n\nSometimes you don't need perfect science confirming what you already know.",

It is true that parents are now inclined to overprotect their kids in the real world and underprotect them online.  \n\nThe performative demands of social media mean that girls are often (unbeknownst to them) being engaged in conversations with strange men for questionable reasons. Boys are spending all their time gaming and watching lots and lots of porn.  They are learning crazy things from porn--such as girls like to be choked during sex (Peggy Orenstein's NYT oped). So now that's a thing and boys and girls have to be told that choking isn't usually something that is desired nor is it usually safe--especially for inexperienced kids in their nascent attempts at sex. And some of the girls are starting to think that maybe choking is good because everyone's doing it.  I just can't.  The whole thing is so sad.

I wish the moguls of technology would turn away from exploiting irresponsible viral content - there is untapped potential for our devices to spur creative collaboration as opposed to fishing for \"likes\".",
        "Back when I was in HS in the late 80's/early 90's you could imagine how much better other people had it but there was no real proof. Now? It's right there on Instagram. In color. Everyone else IS having more everything than you. And you were not invited. Back then people could tease and bully you but at the end of the school day it was basically over. You could go home and do whatever in relative peace until the next day. Now its a 24/7 stream of negativity. \nIs there any piece of technology that we will not mindlessly gobble up? And now we have AI on deck and not one person is asking sensible questions. We just sit here waiting to be replaced.",
        "Again, the question arises: where are parents in all this?  Have they abdicated their responsibilities to the technological babysitter?",
        "Children / teenagers need in person socialization for development ...maybe the less adult supervision the better. All the hovering of control obsessed parents has created a generation of misfits. Smash the phones and computers and let them roam the streets  and forests for fun and games.",
        "What are four things that are significantly different between the U.S. and other advanced democracies?  1. Rises in suicide rates. (Our kids are more depressed.) 2. Gun deaths.  (Maybe it's guns.)  3.  Health-care availability and cost. (Maybe it's the health-care system.)  4. Educational systems. (Maybe it's the schools.) I could go on.  In the meantime, by all means let us blame cell phones.",
        "It's disappointing that Mr. Wallace-Wells didn't incorporate the recent findings out of Norway, which appeared to show significant improvements in a number of mental health and social metrics when smartphones were banned from middle schools. The study covered several hundred schools, and looked quite a bit more rigorous than previous work.",
        "As a psychiatrist who has been treating adolescents (and adults) for over 15 years, and as someone who listens, observes, reads, and reflects on human behavior and culture and society even when away from the clinic, I have no doubt that the incidence of mental illness, and not just formal DSM-V psychiatric disorders, is escalating. I have no doubts that the infiltration of technology, but particularly in the form of a portable, hand held portal to the Internet, plays a major role of in distancing and alienating one human from human being as well distancing and alienating a human from his or her own inner landscapes, his or her own sense of self, and thus failing to form a resilient and cohesive and integrated core and leaving him or her fragmented, fractured, and chronically fatigued. But there are other factors, including break down of family systems, break down of institutions (Congress, Church), break down of shared values and visions. It's a mess",
        "Phenomenal article, thank you Mr. Wallace-Wells (once again). The answer to dips in American teenagers' mental health will never be one note, which is why most people are desperate for an easy scapegoat. Banning social media for teens is also more feasible than say repairing a failing democracy or implementing protections for human rights. \n\nAs a queer and nonbinary person raised in a conservative (read: bigoted) state, social media was the only place I could find community while remaining closeted to my peers and family. Although in-person connections, hobbies, and activities are deeply important, there are many like me who, as a teenager, aren't able to access the support they need offline. The time many people want to go back to (pre social media) is a time where people like me were often isolated and invisible.",
        "I'm a long-time high school teacher, and while this is admittedly anecdotal (and therefore statistically meaningless) evidence, I haven't seen a trend towards suicide and depression over the past decade. Quite to the contrary, my students are much more likely than they were when I first started in the profession to include adults when they're concerned about their friends' mindsets and to encourage their peers to talk to their parents about seeking therapeutic help. Today's teens are more open about their struggles and their feelings, and while social media is definitely a negative influence on teen girls' self image, I hear them dealing with their self image issues in a healthier way. Talk of going to the gym and weight lifting has replaced discussions of fad diets and body fat percentage. Far fewer girls are wearing makeup on a daily basis to school, and they call each other out for body shaming and negative self talk. \n\nThere is so much negativity being discussed in regards to today's youth, but from my corner of the world, the kids are alright.",
        "The fact that this article's title is a question is shocking. Of course.the answer is YES. Haven't we known this for a while?",
        "Smartphones make it so much easier for bad actors to put all sorts of garbage out there to entice teenss into malevolent TikTok or YouTube rabbit holes. That's for sure.  Also, overuse of smartphones by parents or other adults could be a factor in alienating kids.\n\nPersonally I think weed could also be a factor behind mounting mental health problems. The marijuana they sell now has much much more THC than the stuff they sold a few decades ago. Are teens or even young adults prepared to handle that?  I am pretty sure it is affecting several young people I know but good luck bringing up that topic.  I hesitated to type it here...",
        "The \"smartphones are the problem\" explanation for youth mental illness reminds one of the \"guns are the problem\" explanation for an unmoored and violent society.  The common factor is - wait for it - people.  And truth be told it is the young who exhibit the most violent tendencies.  Who made them that way?  Parents?  Politics?  Pole shifts?  Whatever it is and whomever it is to blame, we are thanking our stars we came along in the pre-dystopian time and are permitted the luxury of witnessing rather than participating.",
        "Yes, its smartphones. Not the climate crisis that feels hopeless, the housing crisis, the decline of the middle class, the way workers are treated and compensated that they get to look forward to, the cost of education crisis, the way that cities are planned for cars and are no longer walkable meaning they are inside all the time. Nope, its the phones.",
        "How much does obesity correlate with depression and how does the percentage of obese teens in the US compare, for example, with Denmark?",
        "Screen time on apps designed to give periodic dopamine hits and get kids addicted, combined with the social dynamics of interacting via txt instead of in person:\n1) Are replacing reading books in children's lives\n2) Are contributing to an epidemic obesity\n3) Are contributing to a decreasing ability for young people to make conversation, handle themselves in different social situations, and meet partners\n4) Are replacing essentially every single \"wholesome\" youth activity that is associated with mental and physical development with screen associated pleasure that, for the most part, does not contribute to physical intellectual or emotional growth.\nThere is a reason why smarter parents are more restictive with cell-phones, well there are many, but a major one is because they can more clearly see this huge range of bad outcomes due to screen time.\nKids before 14 or 16 cannot handle the addictive nature of this electronic drug.\nInability to govern addiction is a major reason why many things that are allowed to adults are not allowed to children, and our smart phones and apps like insta and tiktok are AT  LEAST as addictive.\nKids shouldn't have smart phones.\nparents need to unite and agree to wait until mid teans to give them one.",
        "The data are extremely clear that social media, in particular, and, to a lesser extent, smartphones are dramatically increasing the rates of depression, suicidality, ADHD, addiction, academic failure, bullying, abuse, and mental illness in children (and adults).",
        "The ease with which hate spreads online is surely part of this problem.\n\nIt's just so easy to malign someone when you can \"hide\" behind a text message or social media post.\n\nHaidt's lament over the decline of outdoor play among youngsters is also prescient.",
        "Yes, smartphones are driving a teen mental health crisis. Their downsides greatly outweigh their advantages. Next question."
