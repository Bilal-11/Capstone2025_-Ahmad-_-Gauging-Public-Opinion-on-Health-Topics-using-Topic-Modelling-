However, by this assessment to find the affected embryos, we will also find the 3/4 of the embryos that will not be affected.  WE can simply choose to implant an unaffected embryo rather than repair the 1/4 embryos that will be affected.

In other words, our current social environment has no problem with the technology used to bring people up to the average of today, to uplift people suffering from this or that disease to the average, but it does have a problem making people more than average in capability.\n\nThe more people start talking about using the technology to make super humans the more the technology is spoken of as not quite there yet or we don't know the genes or of the technology's potential for evil. But talk about bringing unfortunate people up to average and suddenly the technology is spoken of in glowing terms and that we can accomplish that goal.\n\nSo the layman really gets no accurate scientific picture of the technology and its capacity, the social environment of the day clouds the picture.

The first is that in it\u2019s current state no country explicitly allows heritable gene editing - the use of this technology to affect future populations. The US already does not allow government funds to be used, funds that are used by most companies. Most countries don\u2019t allow it at all. The second piece is that many of the harms presented are overhyped. So many genes interact with one another, so it is a nest impossibility to create \u2018super babies\u2019. We are also already able to chose much about who we give birth to through screening or IVF. Take with a grain of salt the catastrophic scenarios presented.

They see how ADHD has positively shaped their parents' careers; they know ADHD students thrive in some fields because of their divergent thinking. They know ADHD to be not an evolutionary glitch but a vital way of knowing and being in the world that makes it a better place. Yet, when I asked my children what would they do if, in the future, they could select an embryo without ADHD, my son replied with conviction. \"If the education system has not changed, if it still punishes neurodivergence, I would definitely not bring an ADHD child into that world.\" \n\nThis simple observation shook me to the core.

        "The number of variations that genes affect is bewildering. Multiply that by 50,000 or more and the combinations are beyond human or computer analysis. Humans are selfish, especially with their offspring. If there's a chance to create an enhanced human, someone or some group will attempt it, though the results will take years to fully measure. Most cases it's a tradeoff between intelligence as measured by the IQ test, and risks of other maladies like schizophrenia\u2014thus the mad scientist. Mr. He in your article is simply vying for the title of Dr. Frankenstein.\n\nHistorically, there is a linear trajectory from selective breeding, eugenics, euthanasia, and ultimately, genocide. The Nazis and their atrocities still linger in living memory, and a few groups are still active on the far side of politics.\nGeneticists will continue making progress, but scientists can better improve the human conditions on the nurture side of human development, and with a wealth of proven results.\n\nHumans are superbly adept at conceiving and writing about objects and spaces and people that only exist in the abstract, but come short of true representations. That's all well and fine, except scientists tend to cloister in insular and sanitized environments, and they oftentimes lose connections or misinterpret the terrestrial or mundane or quotidian about them.",

As the author notes this issue creates tension between what we want for society and what we want for ourselves. Everyone wants a system of equitable fairplay, but everyone also wants to be competitive. \n\nYears ago George Will wrote about how perinatal screening for Downs in Scandinavia was akin to genocide because many women chose to abort their fetus after a positive diagnosis. I'm a libertarian when it comes to people's procreative desires and I think Will's sentiment was overwrought, but it deserves serious consideration. \n\nAs these technologies progress whether it be CRISPR or perinatal testing we'll be able to edit genes or discard embryos that carry traits some consider to be undesirable. Consider the following: dwarfism, intellectual deficits, body odor, microphallus. There are healthy and thriving people who have these conditions, but will they continue to exist in the future?\n\nParents employing these technologies will have to wrestle with the fact that the line separating them and the eugenicists of the Progessive Era is very thin.

But the problem is already evident in areas where our food is modified genetically.  Do we really know enough about our genetic make up to apply criper effectively and what does effect mean in so many cases.  Do we really want to be 'flawless' super beings and extend our life spans for those who can afford it with this technology?   crisper like nuclear energy is sciences good and bad face and we have not determined which is which.",
        "I have no moral, ethical, or religious objection to gene editing in humans, but I have plenty of practical concerns. There is no safe and thorough way to test the longterm, or even the short term, effects of gene editing in humans. Editing out a defective sequence could have unintended consequences for overall health, some of which might not appear up for years. Not only would you have to follow the experimental subjects for a human lifespan, but what if negative consequences started showing up in their offspring? \n\nThis is not the same thing as gene therapy for a child who is suffering from a life threatening, painful illness like sickle cell anemia or severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In such cases, gene therapy may be the only hope for an already living child, and it is worth taking the risk. Gene editing of the kind discussed in this article is something else entirely, and its risks cannot be justified.",

It would be foolish to pretend to forecast the issues that might arise later, if society continues to flourish, and is not wiped out by nuclear war of global warming.\n\nThis should not detract from the very real benefits that CRISPR-Cas9 and more recent tools, like base and prime editing.  Together with advances in gene sequencing, these technologies promise to provide new tools for treating cancer and other diseases which arise because of deficiencies in genomes of somatic cells.",
        "Human gene editing garners immense interest among my elite college students and my salt of the earth relatives alike. CRISPR-Cas is a remarkably efficient and accurate all-in-one tool, but clinical-grade precision is still being engineered.

There are many, many other inventions that fall into this category, things whose power we either did not understand or ignored to our own peril.\n\nGene editing may dwarf everything that has gone before it (actually, there is one other recent discovery whose ultimate pathway is both vast and unknown and yet we're well on our way down it, AI).\n\nI guess I'd have to advise the public to be careful of what they wish for. There doesn't seem to be a very good system in place for risk/benefit analysis much less a moral and ethical courtroom for science.

Worst of all would be no idea of what consists of better road and bad paving equipment. And we can't think just because we have good paving equipment that automatically means we have an idea of the road we need to pave. We need both, clear vision of the road needed to be paved and reliable road paving equipment.\n\nSupposing we're clearsighted on the above stated, ethical problems and public resistance according to such should decline dramatically. But then again I suppose a lot of people will resist genetic modification of humans out of vanity, feelings of inadequacy, the uncomfortable idea that better human than themselves can be created; in other words a lot of the usual resistance to progress by a significant number of people which can be seen in a lot of areas of life will be magnified when it's discovered that we can create better humans too, humans which are an improvement on past humans.\n\nPersonally I have no problem with a reliable method of making a better human than myself.

Whether that might lead to, and hopefully rarely, ending a pregnancy of a fetus with too many unhealthy abnormalities, may remain an issue to ponder.

Also, the amount this could save in healthcare costs long-term is immense.  Using it to make \"improvements\" is a different matter.  Honestly, I don't think we can keep that in the box either.
