        "Testosterone loss in women after 40 is huge, and therapy in the form of transdermal cream (from a compounding pharmacy) helps your muscles, not just your libido. Have your baseline checked, before you slip into perimenopause, so you can negotiate with your doctor later.\n\nDid you know that there are estrogen AND testosterone receptors in your vestibule? I did not know until after 60. Feeling dry after 40? Getting UTI's? Husband not looking as handsome to you as before? Get some E&T cream up there!\n\nBTW, one of the downstream metabolites of testosterone is...estradiol! Win-win.\n\nGet it while you can. If trumplestiltskin and frumpy-dumpty are in charge, you can say goodbye to lots more of women's healthcare!",
        "Unfortunately most of us don\u2019t work on farms or do construction work, and we tend to eat poorly, half of us are obese. No surprise here. Our bodies were meant to be in constant motion and physically stressed. Lifting  more than 10 lbs is considered heavy at 40? No trick here for most of us, don\u2019t sit down, find ways to keep moving during the day, with at least 20 min/day for a balanced stretching/exercise routine. I bet the trackers many of us wear  will  show we are active for less than an hour/ day\u2026..and btw, go to bed instead of watching TV or device surfing. If you think 40s are kicking.your butt, wait until your 60s and forget about your 80s.",
        "Yeah I'm not a doctor, but my two cents is if you do lots of other stuff, often hard, then maybe this advice said in this article of \"You have lift weights twice a week\"....is not totally on point. I'm male, late 50s in age, swim two days a week (do the flip turns, for your core!) and generally work on/play ice hockey the other five days a week, and my balance is excellent and core is pretty strong (I played pick-up hockey tonite at 9500 ft altitude).  I don't rock climb anymore -- never was good at that - but, for example, older folks who might regularly go to the climbing gym and push their body hard,.....should be good to go, without a weght session.  The idea is to work out hard, your entire life, in some sport you really love, and throw in the appropriate rest days so you don't burn out. There's still time for vegan cooking, reading Sartre, knitting, whatever, but find a strong regular rhythm for working fairly hard in sport, and enjoy the groove.",

Getting out of a car on a road trip was painful and stiff. I completely changed my diet and cut out grains, sugar, and flour. My body now feels like a teenager- all I can attribute it to is stopping from putting things in my body which cause inflammation. Now when I'm tempted I just think of how I ached and turn down the temptation to eat these things.",

I feel no differently than at 24 physically and have no pains anywhere. I do not and have not gone to a gym, lifted weights, jogged, etc. But I have taken HRT (Premarin since I had a hysterectomy at 51) every day, as did my mother who passed recently and was in fabulous shape until the day she died. Maybe its genes, but HRT works for me, as does just a healthy lifestyle doing pleasurable forms of exercise consistently.",
        "40??? Try reaching 70.  Fortunately I've been exercising all my life but I'm a small-framed guy and I don't like lifting weights.  I realize the importance of fighting sarcopenia so I still do my pushups, squats, and leg-lifts every morning (50 each).  Later I speed walk a couple of miles and hit the elliptical at the gym in the afternoon where I can jack up the resistance for the upper-body handles. So far this has been enough, but if I have to go to dumbbells I will.",
        "Yet another article promoting hormone replacement therapy for women, quoting an Instagram influencer to boot. The strong suggestion is that it can boost your workout and protect you from injury in your 40s. Nothing about the risks. \nTo quote an NIH paper, \u201cHRT carries significant risks that are generally well known, including risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism. These risks were most well characterized by several landmark trials published in the early 2000s. There are several nuances to prescribing HRT that can make doing so complex.\u201d\nI think Big Pharma is doing a big push on this, and it unfortunately jibes with a cultural shift that seems ready to go from \u201ctake our bodily woes seriously,\u201d to  \u201cfemales are fragile.\u201d",
        "After reaching 84 years and being overweight with hypoinsulinemia, I embarked on a keto diet and started to exercise regularly. In a gym (where I still go every second day), I paid special attention to the slow improvement of individual muscles. \nA year after that, it was time to start with serious deadlift exercises to strengthen the core muscles in my body. It worked. Now, my walking pattern has changed dramatically with the newly developed stability and confidence with each step.\nIf it worked at my age, just imagine what you can do if you are younger than me.",

        "My sympathies, I too found my 40\u2019s to be hard and had to relearn all I thought I knew.   \n\t\u201chigh-intensity yoga, running and rowing\u201d  Yoga is great for maintaining one\u2019s range of motion and to develop a low level of strength.  Running and rowing are great for cardio and muscular endurance, and low level strength.  Missing is strength focused training.  While almost anything exercise or activity will show some initial results, none will provide the strength results you\u2019ll get from strength training.  When we\u2019re young, everything is great, but as we age, what kept us strong is no longer enough.  We need to challenge our strength with resistance training.   Rep levels for optimum strength training is 5 reps for 3-5 sets, but even reps of 10-12 will still give you increases in strength\nMy two favorites are Starting Strength for focused strength training, and Frank Zane for building both strength and conditioning\n<a href=\"https://startingstrength.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://startingstrength.com</a>/\n<a href=\"https://frankzane.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://frankzane.com</a>/",

I started Pilates in the mid nineties, then yoga, some cycling, and rowing, to round things out. \nNow in my early 60\u2019s my body is still fundamentally in shape. I\u2019ve never gained weight, have a flat stomach and toned arms. However, what\u2019s become clear is that I must work harder to maintain this. Now my program is 5 times a week instead of three and I\u2019ve added resistance training to the mix. \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever imagined it would get easier, so I\u2019ve come prepared.

        "This levels of denial \"And I\u2019m far less intimidated by the notion of turning 50 \u2014 it\u2019s just another decade to get ripped\" are only justified in people who (a) have never payed attention to what happens to people when they enter their 50s (or 60s or 70s), or (b) have never had a health problem. Guess what? We age. And get weaker, and get sick, no matter how much we exercise.

        "I've lived in the desert southwest my entire life. \n\nI have always been amazed when I leave here and travel to New York or Illinois or other states with harsh climates how many people are obese and extremely out of shape. But I get it, too. I imagine it's hard to get motivated to do anything when it's cold and dreary outside for half of the year. And when you live in a city like Chicago or New York, how do you even get a good workout?\n\nI have always known that we were spoiled, living in a desert paradise with few rain days where you can exercise and play sports outside nearly every day. During the hot months exercising outside involuntarily involves sweating and drinking lots of water, both of which are good for your mental state and cleansing your body of excess salt.\n\nHere in Phoenix we have the biggest municipal park in the contiguous US. My wife and I are nearly fifty and we will routinely do one of the many loops on a weekend. For me spending my entire life here, I don't know what I'd do living in a city without this type of access to the outdoors. Yes, going to a gym is fine, but there's something radically different between exercising in a closed space versus being outdoors. It's something spiritual.\n\nI think long-term our country will see net migration out of cities like Chicago and New York that make it hard for people to stay in shape. I foresee the net migration in the country to the south continuing and more people discover the benefits of exercise for aging.",
        "In my 30's and 40's I taught strength training and yoga with classes every day.  At 50 I had a critical health incident that was most probably hereditary.  This event was the beginning of a serious decline in my fitness level.  At 60 I revamped my work outs and exercise regimen.  But, 65 came on with a vengeance!  Suddenly nothing I did seemed to remedy the decline.  NO DOC ever recommended I do any kind of hormone therapy.  NONE.  Specialists and PT were the go to suggestions.  There was no positive outcome from these consults and procedures.  I quit them all and took on a strength training program.  The specific program I am doing is through the group, Max Strength Fitness, a franchised fitness program/gym.  This has been the best remedy for most every issue I have been dealing with.  But.  It is a pay out of pocket program and I am now retired and on medicare so the cost is becoming  prohibitive.  This is something needed in the medicare reimbursement program - at least some portion.",

Now I still run 4-5 times a week, making sure to warm up with a half-mile or mile of walking. On non-running days, I walk. Typical distance is 5-8 miles, but I'm ramping up a bit for a 30K \"race\" (I'm not competitive) in December.\n\nIn the past nine years, I have hiked the three \"Triple Crown\" long trails in North American \u2014 the Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails \u2014 as well as several shorter trails and 200 to 300-mile sections of other longer trails, for a total of more than 10,000 miles.\n\nOn my hikes, I hike with the 20-somethings, because that's my pace/style.\n\nI don't go to the gym (I hate it), but I do strength training using my own body, pushups every day, crunches/ab stuff a few times a week, burpees, squats, etc. \n\nAbout 20 years ago I decided to pay more attention to my weight and diet. Today, I weigh what I did in my mid-20s.\n\nAm I bragging? No. Am I superman? No. Do I feel the aging in my body? Yes. Does it slow me down? Kinda-sorta.\n\nThe point is that, whatever aging is doing to me, my personality has driven me to respond with the above.

I just give them a blank look and say, \u201cListen, by the time you\u2019re 70 EVERYTHING hurts and you don\u2019t have enough time left to figure out WHY they hurt.

The problem is that this is becoming less and less possible in much of the country.\n\nAlready, since Dobbs, 21 states ban or restrict abortion more than the standard set by Roe v. Wade.

What I have learned, now that I'm in the marathon phase, is this.  It's simple, really.  Use it or lose it.

It will do wonders for your back as you learn how to release all the habitual tension that grips every muscle with every activity - something one is so used to one doesnt' even recognize one is doing it. \n\nIt's quite possible that some of your muscles are weak, like your Dr. says, but with the Alexander technique, you learn how to spread the effort through your entire system, so that your entire body is involved in your activities. This helps tone the muscles that need to be involved with whatever activity, and helps reduce the extra work that is being done by other muscles to compensate. \n\nTry a series of 10 or 15 lessons and then write an article about how your back doesn't hurt anymore!",

        "Having gone through the mother of all perimenopauses, I so wish I had understood that the realigning, so to speak, of estrogen sources - meaning that the adrenal glands have to start making up for the losses - can wreak havoc on the whole body. I had it all, except the hot flashes - though I had terrible night sweats. I had migraine, joint and muscle pains, what felt like peripheral neuropathy in the hands and feet, exhaustion - and everything else. What I wish I'd known when I was 40: Supplements, not just a multivitamin, are key. For migraine and neurological-related aches and pains: B2: at least 100 mg per day, up to 400 mg if have migraine. B1, B6: 50mg a day. Folic acid: up to 1mg per day. B12:1000 mcg per day. The B's will help with muscle pain and weakness as well. Have to take them all, as they work together. Very important: Magnesium - malate form is best. Works with calcium to help it absorb rather than sitting outside the joints. Tremendously calming, relaxes muscles. If having migraines, 400mg per day, otherwise 100 - 400 mg, depending on how sore and tight muscles are. Great for the heart. Same amount of calcium - I take 1:1 ratio. Vitamin A and D help the cal and mag absorb, vit C: 500mg, (adrenal gland highly concentrated with C). Vit E: 100 mg, a multi-mineral with iodine, and 20 mg of iron if lower end red blood count, or heavy periods. After 15 years I hugely improved all symptoms by starting this regimen. Will likely take 3 months to start kicking in.",

        "I feel like this information has been around for a long time - use it or lose it, slow degradation of muscle etc - but I think we largely tune it out until, bam, you\u2019re there: mid forties and everything feels different. \n\nSometimes I feel a little extra rage being a woman. I feel barely recovered from the physical upheaval of pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, sleepless nights, domestic servitude and now every conversation amongst my peers seems to be about perimenopause. And to add insult, instead of being held in high regard and valued for our contributions - and allowed rest and recovery - we live in a society where women become invisible and \u201cwashed up\u201d unless we can keep up appearances and do all the things. \n\nI will endeavor to add regular weight lifting to my ever increasing list of to dos, for the sake of my own health, but where on earth will the time and energy come from?",
        "First world problem.\n\nWait 'til you hit 70.",
        "Sweetheart, you have no idea of the huge amount of info \"they\" never tell anyone, about aging. I was never told that being a woman wasn't actually set in stone and nearly all women have to start shaving parts of their faces, at some point. Nobody teaches you about what neuropathy is and how most aging people experience some form of it.\n\nNobody really talks about the constant, excessive phlegm, common digestive system failures, or \"leakage\".  This was never offered to me in any of those classes of Life 101 through Life Advanced. I think it's the biggest practical joke the universe plays.\n\nGood luck, my dear, and we'll all see you out there, peering through your recently eye implants, trying to figure out if you are really seeing what you think you are.",
        "And eat way more protein to support muscles, gut and brain health.",
        "Such an important message when it comes to quality of life and even longevity. Build up that foundation of muscle while you can, then hold onto it for as long as possible. Once you're in your 70s, being weak often leads to falls that cause disability, a loss of independence, and ensuing cardiovascular and mental declines. \n\nAlso, for women, I've heard strength training can be a great way to decouple your body image from an unhealthy obsession with a number on a scale.",
        "I've exercised since my mid thirties, am 79 now. I still do bench presses, pullups (3 is my current limit, down from 23 in my forties), and other weight exercises, as well as multiple bicycle rides weekly.  I'm pretty happy with my current status, although I do see that I am slowly losing balance, and strength. \n\nUse it or lose it is the name of the game. If you think you're going to age gracefully sitting on your butt, bad news for you.",
        "Oh, just wait until you hit 70!\nThere's more!",
        "I'm a former Navy pilot, trained by the United States Marine Corps.  The result is that I've exercised into my 70's.  The example I set for my two sons meant that they also exercise (they're 45 and 48).  But they do weight training whereas I have slacked off.\n\nThe article is spot on - weight training I desperately need to begin.  I find myself struggling to lift things, and my upper body is pretty weak.\n\nThank you for an excellent article."
