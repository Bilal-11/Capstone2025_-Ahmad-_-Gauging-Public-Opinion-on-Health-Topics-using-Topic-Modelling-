Yours and mine might differ wildly. But surely we can all agree that babies are precious and sacred, quite literally our future, add great meaning to people's lives, not to mention are necessary for our economy. However you'd scarcely know it from the endless parade of articles bemoaning (and greatly exaggerating) how difficult it is to kill them.\n\nIt's plain to see that the media's obsession with abortion rights fits right into their promotion of a culture of easy anonymous sex, childlessness, and ultimately loneliness and misery. Why not promote stable and committed families instead?\n\nAbortion legality is a complex and sensitive topic and I'm not prescribing a position on it here.

Even syphilis, once on the verge of becoming eradicated, is again prevalent. \n\nIt is rather rich that conservative groups like the Catholic Church, while settling lawsuits over child sex abuse, continue to tirelessly moralize over sexuality.  These groups work both to legislate against reproductive health and undermine our public health system. \n\nThe OB/GYN doctors highlighted in this piece understand that their patients problems are personal, biological, and deeply connected with individual circumstance. Seldom are they moral. \n\nWe live in a world where in certain places women are banned from looking a man in the eye or even showing their face in public. Even these draconian rules don\u2019t stop miscarriage, hemorrhage, fatal fetal anomaly, infection, amniotic fluid imbalance, early rupture of membranes, and so on. They simply serve to put women under a religious regime. \n\nSo how about we stop moralizing about our sexual health, fund women\u2019s health and offer men something as well, perhaps funding for vasectomies and STD screening.",

The restaurant was packed, so I had to take a seat at the bar. I was close to finishing my meal when I heard a commotion behind me.  A woman, surrounded by her friends, was having an emotional break down.  I got up and offered my seat to her.  She took my seat, I paid my bill and left.\n\nAbout a week later, I went back to that same establishment. That same woman was sitting in the outdoor seating with her daughter.   She remembered me and graciously invited me to join them.  \n\nThe daughter and I started talking politics.  She was going to vote for George W. Bush.  I brought up the possibility of Rowe being overturned, which was also discussed back then in the media.

Miss me with the fake outrage.",
        "Congress had nearly 50 years to pass legislation codifying a woman's right to choose.  Granted, getting this through Congress, especially when it is divided (dem. house and rep. senate, or vice versa) or when POTUS opposed it (all GOP) meant it was impossible.  \n\nThe other problem is a lack of courage.  Congress cares more about grift and fundraising and getting elected and re-elected, so they were thrilled to be able to punt this to SCOTUS.  SCOTUS can't be voted out of office when it issues unpopular or just plain stupid rulings.  \n\nBut the radical theocrats played the long game, and in their Savior Trump they got 3 SCOTUS justices in addition to other GOP justices and once they got theocrats on SCOTUS, then this is the first step.  Ban abortion.  Yes, yes, so far it is up to the states, but when Trump returns to power, Congress and Trump will enact a national ban, so abortion in the blue states will be outlawed.  After that, contraception, gay marriage, and all of the other \"rights\" that currently fall under the right to privacy.  They won't respect the separation of church and state either.  We'll resemble Iran or Afghanistan than the kind of country we had for decades past.  \n\nI'm saddened and sickened by these stories and by the suffering of women and girls.  \n\nThose of you who are eligible to vote, this election matters.  Vote blue up and down the ticket, and then pressure your reps to codify Roe.  \n\nOtherwise, we're chattel and livestock (no say over our bodies).",

In my state, Wisconsin, this puts our women and babies directly in harms way.",
        "Incredible reporting but no surprise for those of us who remember the horrible patch work of laws before Roe. V Wade when abortion was illegal in 30 states. \n\nIn 1971 I was 17 and hospitalized with life threatening complications from an unwanted pregnancy while enrolled in a Chinese language program at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. My parents who lived in Illinois checked me out of the hospital in Missouri where abortion was illegal and put me on a plane to NYC where my older brother who lived in New Jersey met me and took me to get an abortion at a Manhattan clinic on the last day of my first trimester, as permitted by New York State laws. \n\nI was forever grateful to New York and moved to the city years later to attend a graduate program at Columbia University and had a rich and rewarding career as a single working woman in NYC and beyond.",
        "In 1973, the SCOTUS in Roe issued a decision that was legally flawed. There is simply no right to abortion in our Constitution. The more recent SCOTUS decision remanding the issue of abortion to the states is legally correct. It reflects a more reasonable interpretation of our Constitution.

        "The core of the problem is that conservatives cannot acknowledge (much less cope with) the real complexity of pregnancy. \n\nPregnancy is not a Disney movie. It  presents real health risks. A zygote, embryo or nonviable fetus does not have the same physical or moral standing as the woman in whose body it resides. \n\nThere are reasons that it may be essential to terminate a pregnancy and (to some) overly casual reasons for doing so -- but inserting the government into making those decision would involve a level of intrusion few people are willing to accept. '\n\nThe reality is that in Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade weighed the rights of privacy and liberty v. government interests correctly.

But it would be better to deal with the cause, the SCOTUS.\n\nThe concept of SCOTUS was based on honest judges rulling based on the constitution.\nWhat happens when the assumption is not met? \n\nSome would answer that congress has the power to rain the SCOTUS. So I asked what happens when congress is not doing it? What happens with the GOP and the SCOTUS are operating with a \"want to be dictator\", imposing personal religous beliefs, slowing down justice department investigations?\n\nThe system is broken, including the seperation of powers and the check and balance concept.\n\nThis SCOTUS is like the \"blue screen of death\" on a frozen computer screen. It needs a major reset (or power off, wait 10 seconds and turn on).\n\nThe only rest button I see is for president Biden to use the new absolute immunity to officials deal with the SCOTUS. They intended to give that power to trump, but Biden still has time to protect us using the new power.\n\nI think it is the only way. Anything else including complaints about the SCOTUS gets back the the same SCOTUS. It is a broken system in need of urgent repair.",
        "This is what happens when courts and politicians interfere in people's personal or religious decisions. Abortion is a religious and/or personal issue. No one has a right to interfere. but the ultra-right wing fundamentalist Supreme Religious Court decided they had to tell everyone in America that we have to follow THEIR religion.",
        "When The Times writes what overturning Roe did to \"women in this country\", I only want to point out that there is a very large percentage of women who view overturning Roe as a way to preserve the life of unborn fetuses, in other words, these women are pro-life.  Women make up a majority of the population, I believe, in every state in the union.  If women - all women - supported the right-to-choose, there would be no abortion bans anywhere in the country.  But they don't, and I'm only guessing but I'll wager that there are states where nearly a third (if not more) of all women support abortion bans.  I just think it's important to point this out  because the press often gives the mistaken impression that nearly all women are pro-choice.  That's most certainly not the case, and the numbers of women who are pro-life is large enough that it should be acknowledged whenever the issue of \"abortion\" and \"women\" is brought up.",
        "It feels like an attack on womanhood. And it is. The refusal of red states to convene a medical panel to clarify exactly when abortions can be provided in a crisis pregnancy, it\u2019s as though they are making these women pay for all the legal abortions that happened in the prior 50 years.",

        "FDR famously proclaimed, \"The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself\".  The Supreme Court with a religious mindset and without a Constitutional mandate has created fear in this country.  While we are 50 states, we are one nation.  Trump is dead wrong when he says that everyone wanted abortion remanded to the States.  That's not a fact.  Well over 60% of the nation wanted abortion safe and legal in America.  Trump and his Supreme Court minions sent the matter to the junior varsity legislatures within our states.  Some of the most corrupt bodies of legislation in the country.  They are led like oxes by the nose ring by the road preachers who gin up the abortion matter.  Every one of those Supreme Court justices when asked during their Senate hearings about Roe v. Wade told the public it was settled law.  They all lied.  So now the fear that Roosevelt spoke of is very real and many women with complex pregnancies, accidental pregnancies and life impacting pregnancies know real fear in many of our states.  The blame lies with the USSC and Donald Trump.",
        "This is the hardship and chaos for women 'leaving it up to the states' hath wrought. Trump calls it a beautiful thing and  boasts about overturning Roe. He would confirm more reactionary judges to the federal courts making the situation even more precarious.\n\nI'm depending on the women of America to show up and vote like never before because their rights are on the ballot. Trump's MAGA acolytes claim to be pro life but have no problem putting women's lives at risk to achieve their political ends. As it stands, women are now third class citizens behind men and a fetus.",
        "To those commenters who think this is just about abortion, what it is really about is women's legal right to make our own healthcare decisions and our ownership of our own bodies. To those who shrug when others' rights they they don't personally value are stripped away, just remember that those bent on controlling others are never satisfied. One day you may find yourself thinking, \"First, they came for the women...\"",
        "The Supreme Court correctly ruled in Dobbs that there was no right to privacy in the US Constitution, the principle on which Roe rested.

Rates among white women nearly doubled \u2014 from 20 per 100,000 to 39.1. And Black women, who historically have higher chances of dying while pregnant, during childbirth or soon after, saw their rates go from 31.6 to 43.6 per 100,000 live births.While maternal mortality spiked overall during the pandemic, women dying while pregnant or during childbirth rose consistently in Texas following the state\u2019s ban on abortion, according to the Gender Equity Policy Institute.\u201d",

His 2 successors, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, were also both pro-choice, and the democratic party had large margins in both houses of Congress until 1980. At the time, most states had large democratic majorities in their legislatures. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and  Barack Obama had large democratic congressional majorities early in their terms. Yet, none of these democratic politicians lifted a finger to codify Roe into law.\n\nI am not pointing fingers, but why is that ? Abortion did not really become a national issue until Reagan. Why did no one think to codify Roe? One of my  college professors, in the late 1980s, told us that dozens of anti abortion laws, some dating to the 19th century, were technically still on the books in many states. Roe had invalidated them, but they in theory could become active again should Roe be overturned. \n\nWhy didn't anyone think about this? We are now stuck with this mess.",

The suffering  documented in this article isn't an incidental effect that the perpetrators of abortion bans have overlooked or chosen to ignore.

        "I wholeheartedly believe in a woman's right to have an abortion if she desires one.  Nonetheless, I can't help but think that a lot of things have to happen before a woman chooses to have an abortion.  The woman has to have sex, she has to not use birth control, and not use the morning after pill if she did have unprotected sex.   If all 3 of those things  have happened, she then has to not get a pregnancy test  in the first 6 weeks afterwards in states which have a 6 week limit on abortions.  Last I checked, no supreme court ruling caused her to make these choices, even though one would think that the Dobb's decision would actually make people more careful.\n\nOf course, there are instances in which birth control fails or a situation arises in which the health of the mother is in danger or a fetus has severe birth defects.  These  account for the vast minority of abortions and these should of course be protected (as all access to abortion should be).  Most abortions occur because people are are irresponsible.  You can't blame the supreme court for that.",

Woman under the Supreme Court and many state legislatures do not have the fundamental right to control their own bodies.  Men can control their bodies - but woman cannot.  It's all about power.

This will largely end the current court\u2019s demolition of our rights and liberties.  In its place, Congress currently has the power to create a national circuit court of appeals staffed by randomly selected judges from the existing circuit courts for short terms of no more than five years, or through some other scheme that will limit the influence of any single judge or group of judges. Congress may deem such a court to be the court of final appeal in all cases outside of the Supreme Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, which are the vast majority of cases in the federal courts.

Years ago me and my 19 year old girlfriend opted for a surgical abortion in a ban state and we traveled to a state where abortion was allowed. The logistics were easy (even though we were working class teens) but the trauma involved ended our relationship. \n\nContrary to the representations here, trauma for women seeking abortions in ban states is avoided by most and mostly because of the availability of medical abortions. And while many women are all on board with the abortion decision, many are not. So the abortion decision can cause great trauma for many regardless of state laws. \n\nThe most common argument is that abortion bans traumatize all pregnant women, but that is mostly untrue.

Reaching back centuries for precedents to outlaw this 50-year old precedent should have been a hint that their decision to end abortion was not going to be an easy one to defend.  \nThe rule about access to abortion is simple: restore its legality in the WHOLE United States by codifying it.  Then, if you don't want to have an abortion or don't believe in it, don't have an abortion.  The constitution guarantees a  right to freedom of religion, but it should also guarantee a right FROM other people's religion.

The diagnosis came at 24 weeks, after a clear NIPT test and normal 20 week anatomy scan, when my OB noticed that I'd ballooned with excess amniotic fluid and sent me for an off-the-schedule scan (deemed by my insurer to be unnecessary, so we paid out of pocket).  The termination was a story that could be featured in this article, even before Dobbs, since even my home state of NY didn't allow for me to have an abortion at that time.

I can't think of any.\n\nThe idea that a completely insentient complex of cells has \"rights\" that supersede those of an actual person seems preposterous on its face, at least from a secular, non-teleological perspective.\n\nAbortion was legal in pre- and post-colonial America as it was considered a fundamental right under common law.\n\nI thought the government was supposed to be secular. [Or at least that is what Madison, the author of the Constitution, said was the intent at the time.]",

While I identify as conservative, I believe outright bans aren't the answer\u2014there should be reasonable limits, as outlined in Roe v. Wade.\n\nHowever, we rarely discuss the rights of men in these situations. Why does \"my body, my choice\" apply only to women? Men should also have the option to opt out of parental responsibilities, especially in cases where the pregnancy results from casual relationships, such as a college fling or a one-night stand. In such cases, it seems unfair that men are legally obligated to provide child support, based solely on a woman\u2019s decision to carry the pregnancy to term. If women have the autonomy to choose, men should have a comparable right to decide whether they want to take on that responsibility. Otherwise, men face legal and financial consequences, including jail for something beyond their control. We need a more balanced approach that respects the rights of both gender.",

However if someone becomes deathly ill from illegal or overdose of legal drugs or alcohol abuse they are treated.

That would squash draconian abortion laws immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s their own fault\u201d applies to all of the above. Where is the plaintiffs bar? Where is the leadership?

Drugging people and cutting them open are wrong, generally speaking.\n\nMedicine takes place in a special system of restricted justification (i.e. formal privilege, or private law).\n\nIf a doctor tells you they're performing a procedure because \"it's not illegal\" you should probably run away fast.  The reason medical procedures are not held to the general law of the land is that they are supposed to be held to a much HIGHER standard of necessity and justification than ever applies to the general public.",
        "I predict that this will go the way that prohibition eventually ended.  It\u2019s similar in many ways - a deeply unpopular decision that had many unintended consequences, a decision based on very conservative religious beliefs that people found ways to circumvent.  Prohibition led to bootleggers, speak easies, and the rise of gangsters like Al Capone, a favorite of Donald Trump.  Dobbs has led to the stories I just read or listened to.\n\nCountries like Ireland and Poland with strict anti-abortion laws had a big difference in that the law was national and uniform, and the laws were eventually changed when horror stories came out.  It wasn\u2019t a patchwork of states with different policies.  Doctors and health providers here don\u2019t have to stay in states that endanger their licenses, their livelihood, their freedom or their ability to treat their patients properly.  Who would want to practice medicine constantly on edge with the chance of breaking the law or being sued for malpractice when you can just move to a saner, safer state?  I predict a future of a shortage of doctors in these restrictive states that will be unacceptable to the general population.  And then, just like the repeal of prohibition, reproductive rights will be restored.  Unfortunately, a lot of damage will be done in the interim.",
        "And yet women and the men who claim to love them will continue to not vote at all or vote for Republicans because they allow themselves to hoodwinked by the Republican siren song of lower taxes.

I find I really have to work hard to remain compassionate.",

She collapses on a cross country flight, and the plane is diverted to Texas, where a new law has just been put into place. Remember, this is CURRENTLY a fictional scenario. The woman cannot have a D & E (dilation and evacuation) because the dead fetus is considered a dead person, and the D & E procedure would be considered desecration of a corpse, a felony. She is also barred from leaving Texas to have the procedure because that act is also a felony. If I interpreted things correctly, the woman is serving as a test case for the new law. The fact that she may become septic while she waits to go into labor naturally is apparently unimportant for all the legal wonks involved. \n\nCompletely thought-provoking.\n\nRemember, dear readers, this is fiction. For now.",

Women over 50 are parents, grandparents, aunts, sisters, friends, co workers. Hello life threatening situations even if one is against all abortion access. And this, this same man, stole the OT wages of his employees/court ordered to pay them back. And yet, here we are. He\u2019s considered a viable candidate.

The pill is relatively cheap, really cheap compared to raising a child. Make the man wrap up, or use an IUD.\nBefore I get pilloried by the rape or incest argument, of course those should have abortion access, but those amount to less than one percent of pregnancies.\nWomen, your government has abandoned you, best get used to the fact that controlling you own body includes before getting pregnant.",

Contrary to most of the opinions I read in the NYT,  I agree with the Supreme Court that there is no constitutional right to an abortion. If you think otherwise, look it up, and share your thoughts. I do agree that women, generally within the Rove v Wade framework, should have the right to an abortion. This can be done by state or US constitutional amendments or by politiicians acting upon the will of their constituents and passing laws. Vote.",
        "These laws are intentionally written in vague, overly-broad language so that doctors and hospitals will be too frightened to perform any abortions. When a woman dies or suffers permanent damage to her health, the lawmakers always cover themselves by claiming that the exceptions would have covered her situation. The reality, though, is that prosecutors and judges are the only ones who can decide whether an exception was properly interpreted. What doctor is willing to risk their career and/or freedom on that? Another feature of these laws, not a bug.\n\nThe only way to right this horrific situation is through action at the national level. That only happens with Democratic control of the White House and both houses of Congress. Direct action may work in some states, but many states have no provision for voter-driven ballot initiatives. Voting on November 5th is the only way to stop this.",

They knew precisely what would happen after Dobbs, so in a very real way, each of them voted positively for what now is happening. We have it because they want it.\n\nIt is similar to the Court's evisceration of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County decision in 2013. The case of characters on the Court was different, but all of the members of the majority knew exactly what sorts of voter-suppression methods their decision would unleash. They, like the Dobbs majority wanted it.\n\nNow we have it.",

Women are dying. They are being denied basic health care, life-saving interventions, and bodily autonomy and freedoms. Half of our country\u2019s civil rights have been stripped. And we\u2019re left to fight for ourselves. \n\nThe OBGYN doctors, nurses, and medical professionals are heroes and have more courage and morality in their pinky toes than the entire GOP Congress and Supreme Court justices (Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Thomas and Roberts) combined.",

Every \u201cpro-life\u201d voter and every political candidate and Supreme justice should be required to read this article and asked, \u201cIs this chaos and fear really what a 21st century nation should allow?\u201d If they excuse such abuses, then it becomes ever more transparent that as with many Trump- era policies, the deliberate meanness is the point. My admiration to those brave advocates who reach out to help under such awful threats- the medical staff and hotlines giving answers to scared women and their families, the pilots and hosts helping the needy. Every one of them has more moral strength than the \u201cprolifers\u201d who impose their personal religious beliefs on everyone else and justify wanting to police and control women\u2019s lives and bodies. And for anyone who reads this, Trump\u2019s new claims to be \u201cgood for women\u201d should be met with disbelieving ridicule, followed by a fury impelling you to go out and vote up and down the ticket for candidates who understand that women are equal citizens who deserve the right to make their own decisions for their physical health, emotional well-being, and personal lives."
