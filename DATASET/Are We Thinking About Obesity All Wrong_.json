        "In 1954, 45% of adults smoked cigarettes--roughly equivalent to obesity today. We did not respond to that health crisis by trying to normalize smoking because some smokers are healthy for much of their lives. Normalizing obesity because it is so prevalent is equal madness. And discussing it as a public health crisis is not 'fat shaming.' \nPeople smoked cigarettes because they were marketed to them young, made cheap and plentiful, available every 10 feet, could by smoked everywhere, and there weren't aids to quitting like nicotine patches. We worked HARD as a society to change that. We CAN do the same with obesity.",
        "If you see current pictures of groups of people in other parts of the world than the U.S., everyone looks pretty thin and trim.  We go back to the 50's and 60's in the U. S. and again you see slender, active bodies.  Whatever is the cause, it does not look like disease.  It clearly starts with young children. \nWhy?",
        "Every weight related article in the NY Times has a comment section FILLED with folks spouting the usual nonsense about obesity/diets/weight control etc. Lots of \u2018Fat shaming\u2019 Lots of \u2018I\u2019ve given up sugar/white flour/whatever and I\u2019m perfect now! \n\nThis is just an article about how BMI is a faulty measure of health. Why does that have to be followed by so many judgmental posts about fat Americans. If you\u2019ve never been fat: good for you! That carries the exact moral superiority of never having arthritis! If you\u2019ve been fat but found a way to manage it: good for you! That\u2019s hard! But what worked for you is probably not transferable to everyone else in the world. And most people still struggling with their weight have TRIED it.",

GET OVER IT!!! \n\nSTILL, excess adiposity is reliably associated with increased health risk and mortality. PERIOD. END OF STORY. Get angry at the food industry.\n\nObesity in the US is capitalisms perfect storm. \u2018Our overly processed food will make you fat, but our new drugs will make you skinny again.\u2019 Necessity is truly the mother of invention!",

        "BMI is a joke.  According to it I am overweight.  I'm 65 have a body fat percentage under 12% which is less than 40 percent of the average for my age. I bench press 180 lbs and deadlift 250. My wife is obese according to BMI, she runs half marathons and will do a 62 mile bike ride for her 62nd birthday.\n\nThe issue isn't obesity its fitness that matter.  See a lot of not noticeably overweight people who are terribly unfit, can barely walk to the end of the block and I see people BMI obese at the gym in great shape.",
        "Surely we jest?\n\nThis is a case where we should listen to the insurance companies.  They define obesity by the costs incurred due to increased disease.   Obese people have higher rates of diabetes, cancer, heart disease etc.  Insurance companies up rates by weight.  The more you weigh, the more you pay.  Simple enough.\n\nWhether or not you define obesity as a disease or not, there are repercussions.  Those repercussions matter in terms of quality of life, length of life, and costs to the obese and society as a whole.  Therefore, we should do something about obesity, that is, we should treat it.  Everyone benefits.\n\nIf insurance doesn't want the job/cost, and hospitals don't want the job, unless they are compensated, then let the government take on the job.  Use actuarial tables to determine the risk, provide an appropriate plan to address the problem - as determined by a qualified physician - and insert patient.  As long as the patient is following the treatment pathway, the bills get paid.  Everyone benefits.",

They insist I must secretly have one or several forms of cancer, and therefore I'm somehow decimating the healthcare industry.\n\nDesignating obesity as an illness didn't reduce the stigma, it just made people think I'm both lazy and diseased.",

        "The question of whether obesity is a disease or a risk factor strikes me as mostly meaningless and irrelevant. It reminds me of the highly esoteric medieval theological debates about the exact nature of Trinity in Christianity.\nEven if obesity is \u201cjust\u201d a risk factor, it is an extreme one. There is simply no way to be obese and stay healthy for an extended period of time. Serious health problems will develop, even in young people. \nAs a practical matter, this means that we, as a society, should concentrate of helping people attain and maintain healthy weight and view this task as urgent. Both individual and collective efforts are needed here, and it is certainly not as simple as just telling people that it is their responsibility to eat healthy and eat less. The current practices of the food industry, both of the restaurants and of the grocery stores, need to substantially changed, and it also applies to how food is being advertised on TV and in other media. In the long run, changing the restaurant and fast food menu options to something more healthy and including calorie counts there will probably have greater effect than making Ozempic cheaper and more widely available.",
        "I don't see anything about our food systems and diets. Maybe our consumption of ultra processed foods and lack of exercise are largely responsible for high rates of obesity. Weren't our ancestors  more physically active and more likely to eat unprocessed food? We are exposed to so many chemicals and additives without general knowledge of how they affect our digestion and metabolism.",
        "Obesity is a risk factor in outcomes that include diseases and split pants. The point at which stored nourishment becomes a cause of dysfunction in the body is what lab tests reveal, but it's not simple enough to be a deterministic process, one that one can anticipate from the description of well defined natural processes. Sometimes it never happens, often it does but when and how are still not predictable. \n\nIt is not a condition that results from malfunctioning cells or organs or pathogens, so the assertion that is a disease not rational. Overeating is an evolutionary solution to the uncertainties about getting enough nourishment, the body stores what it does not use for when food becomes scarce. Since the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry, storing fat has become necessary far less often and results in chronic overweight and obesity. The inclination to overeat must be resisted by conditioning habits to stop eating before one feels full.",
        "Why wasn't Obesity a disease prioor to the 1980s? Has anyone ever done a study on the effects of GMOs in our food supply and the effects it has on metabolism, health and brain functions? No, because the Monsanto lobby is all up in every congress-person's grill, in both houses and parties. The 1980's were also the beginning of the \"drive up window\" - so people could be even more sedentary in their pursuit of junk food. Even with Ozempic, we see people in entertainment \"proudly\" large, or whatever socially acceptable term they are using for being morbidly overweight. Somehow that is now celebrated, probably because 40% of our population is obese, so it's a fashion marketing opporunity. I'm no scientist, nor is Oprah (who, btw has has been body dismorphic her entire life, so she calls it a \"disease\" to make more money and settle her ego). People had to walk to the bus/train, park and walk into a restaurant, walk their children, even get out of their chairs to change the TV channel. Now everything is \"as a service\" or a click away. Pills and excuses, and nomenclature for being fat does nothing to solve the problem. Movement, commitment, eating less and more healthy is possible, for anyone and everyone. And let's face it - people are getting sympathy instead of an honest assessment and plan to lose weight. I'm guessing that 1-2% of our population has a legitimate health reason for being obese. It is certainly not something 40% of our population should have.",
        "Obesity is not hard to define. Just try pinching the flesh at your waist. A large, but firm waist is not a sign of obesity. But a soft, flabby one is.",
        "Congratulatons, New York Times!\nAnother piece on obesity with nary a mention of endocrine disruptors in our environment and in food and food packaging. Check the Endocrine Society's website on \"obesogens\".\nI was at my highest weight 25 years ago, having been on antidepressants and prescription stimulants, all taken so that I could manage my job.\nI was desperate and considering surgery, which was not a good option for me because I respond to anesthesia quite badly. I also doubt that I would have managed the bariatric surgery well and found out later that I had intestinal permeability.\nI lucked into several things - an acupuncturist who was friendly to people w/long-term weight problems. (A rarity, admittedly.) I also found a great massage therapist.\nIt was my first foray into alternative medicine. I really was blessed with great help.\nI lost 80 pounds in the next two years with almost no effort, in large part because the acupuncture and the massage helped me relax and to start sleeping well. My eating moderated naturally. I was shocked. I had no idea it was even possible.\nMy dad struggled with obesity later in life. He was a PhD in pharmacology (from Yale) and a toxicologist, but also an athlete, a large, tall, muscular man. He always made an effort.\nOne thing I know about research and reporting - it needs to be done by those who understand obesity and have compassion for it, and discernment about it. There is much aversion and projected ignorance. It's unhelpful, and wrong.",
        "As a previously obese person I feel I have more experience than most on this issue. There are some folks who are obese because of medication or some other \u2018legitimate\u2019 reason. But the vast majority of Americans are obese because they eat too much of the wrong kind of foods. It\u2019s also an education issue. It\u2019s not an accident that the most obese states are also the most illiterate. I find it ironic that when people were lobbying against smoking they used the healthcare excuse but where is that excuse for obese people? It costs us billions of dollars a year in healthcare costs because of obesity. But no one\u2019s talking about that.",

        "We might consider shifting to body composition analysis, which would reveal fat, muscle, bone content and give the patient a clearer view of their metabolic health.  This could be repeated over time to let obsese patients watch their body composition improve - more muscle, less fat, hopefully.\n\nThe scan costs money, but that cost might easilly be recouped if it reduces obesity disease over a lifetime.",
        "You know if you are height and weight appropriate lets stop with the defining. Genetics loads the gun and lifestyle pulls the trigger. You can't change your genetics but you can live more healthy with diet, exercise, positive relationships and managing your stress. When you have the healthcare industry making drugs because the medications they prescribe can make you obese,  we have a far bigger problem than defining if you are \"fat.\"",
        "Move the goalpost!? what is needed: a clearer correlation between metabolic indicators and health. We even need a definition of \u2018health\u2019. Longevity may be the best indicator if \u2018quality of life\u2019 is part of the metric. Healthcare expense [inversely] should also be in. [so if a transplant extends life ?]",
        "We all know that most quickly available, on-the-go food is over processed and full of fat and carbs, and heavy advertising of these foods push them on us.We also have a bad culture around eating, unlike the French. Americans feel permission to eat all day long, wherever they are, and that is obviously a recipe for disaster. If we planned our meals, ate at a table, not in our cars, took time to eat, ate with others, and ate primarily home cooked meals we would look different and feel different, I think. Our towns also need more bike paths (my town has none), more parks, and hiking areas, to encourage activity, and community gardens to grow fresh vegetables.",
        "This is a timely topic and to be honest only the tip of the iceberg in medicine.  We also need good descriptions, definitions, laboratory tests and treatment protocols for many \u201csquishy\u201d conditions such as prediabetes, carcinomas in situ, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in addition to obesity.  Part of our problem may lie in how much of what we think we know is influenced by what we are currently able to see.  Is the situation we are facing similar to the old saw that to someone with a hammer every problem looks like a nail.  Take diabetes for an example.  We have broadly divided it into Type 1 and 2.  Is it simply a disease of elevated glucose?  Our treatments are certainly slanted that way but the disease seems to progress with our current \u201c management\u201d and we never seem to be able to cure it.  Obesity also seems to be a much more complex entity with \u201ccorpulence\u201d only one manifestation.  Defining the whens and whys of metabolic consequences certainly will be critical as we move forward, especially as we seem for the first time to have effective pharmaceutical tools for treatment.  I for one would want this information to help me to decide whether to embark on life long drug therapy.  That said, however, we cannot lose sight of the fact that obesity also has a profound psychological element that has to be taken into account when making treatment decisions.  I applaud this author for starting the public discussion of this important medical topic.",
        "Seriously high time reconsider BMI. Mine puts me at overweight, yet my body fat is 11%, I run a mile in 5:30 and can do 25 pull ups before failing. My waist is 30\u201d - the smaller end of most men\u2019s pants. I\u2019ve never worried about obesity for myself - nor have my doctors - but always thought it absurd that some generic stat could put me in that category and wondered how much damage that could do at scale. Meanwhile, there are people lighter than me at my height who deal with debilitating health issues related to diet but BMI doesn\u2019t capture.",
        "Boy, our society loves to call everything a disease or a disorder rather than identify the culprit as simply being unhappy in life. Weight gain is truly a symptom of depression. When you lack motivation to exercise and seek pleasure foods to self soothe, you are bound to gain weight. And once you gain weight, it becomes harder to break the cycle. Sure, a lot of us feel overworked at our jobs and therefore have no energy or time to exercise\u2026.but if you want to get existential about it, that\u2019s a form of depression. You are participating in a job that is making you sick. In reading through the comments, a lot of valid points are made but I saw nothing mentioning our work culture. Aside from a generalized \u201cpoverty\u201d comment about lack of affordable healthy food, no one sees a problem with how capitalism contributes to our lifestyle? How we have no time or money to enjoy healthy outlets (like travel, physical activities, etc)? We come home and collapse on our couches. We don\u2019t need medical professionals or scientists to label obesity as something out of our control.",
        "I have a picture of my mother standing on steps with her high school class, all female, back in the 1950s. Not a single young woman was fat.

        "How to define obesity and what the BMI really means are what lay people worry about. As a primary care physician, these factors were the least of my concerns. On the practical level of treating patients, I don't use the BMI to diagnose any disease; the common diseases of obesity diabetes, hypertension, muskuloskeletal stresses) are the majority of patients I treat and these conditions are easily diagnosed with objective tests. The truly unhealthy persons with excess fat are easy to differentiate from muscular football players. For the borderline overweight vs obese, for pre-diabetics, patients with hypertension, cardiac diseases, why not emphasize life style changes, refer for nutritional consultations for healthy eating. I'm more than gratified to just get diabetics to lower their glucose levels and control blood pressures in hypertensives.",

Unfortunately, getting a measurement of body fat itself is currently expensive, inaccurate, or both. \n\nWith the vast amounts of money being spent on obesity research and medications, it\u2019s striking how little progress has been made in coming up with a faster, cheaper, and more convenient way to measure body fat percentage and fat distribution throughout the body.",
        "The following story was a revelatory moment for me:\n \nYears ago I was trimming weed at a remote mountain cabin with a significantly overweight co-worker. After a few days she ran out of highly processed snacks, soft drinks, energy drinks, and was now forced to rely on my cache of  'real' food. Not necessarily low calorie, but nutritious and healthy. (I'm a hearty eater who loves all kinds of food.) Enough for several meals a day, plus snacks.\n\nWe decided to turn this situation into \"fat camp'' of sorts since we were stuck there until the job was done. When we took breaks, we trudged slowly up and down the mountain a bit.\n \nWow!  After just 4 days, my friend's energy improved, hiking was easier, her outlook better, more productive, sleeping improved, \nand there was a visible weight loss.\n So much more energy!\n\nThe takeaway for me was that obese people need comprehensive therapeutic SUPPORT, and modeling of healthy habits, as a priority.\nThe root cause for this disorder must be addressed. Childhood trauma, neglect; it is universal.\n I'm the first person who ''really cared'' about my friend's health predicament, I was told.  \nIsolation is a symptom, and a cause. \n\nImportantly,  we were eating normally--not ''dieting''. This was a revelation for my friend, the veteran of countless failed diets.",
        "My father who lived past 100 used to say your waistline is your lifeline. When I was diagnosed with trunkal obesity, I tried for this entire century to lose weight. In Nov. 2020 I had severe COVID and I lost 40 pounds but I was unable to manage my blood glucose levels due to type II diabetes. My cardiologist prescribed Ozempic to keep my blood glucose at normal levels but that also reduced my weight and my waistline. Everyone notices the weight reduction to near ideal weight which is height in inches times 2 and ody Mass Index around 21. So I have gone from a BMI of around 30 to 21, mainly because of severe COVID. I would neither recommend getting COVID to reduce weight nor Ozempic to reduce weight. That was not what FDA approved Ozempic for. \n\nModifying life style with consuming a low calorie balanced diet with intermittent fasting,  regular exercise and daily accelerated sweating in a dry sauna can help lose weight without any side effects of high dose Ozempic that could be a big problem.",

Yes, BMI is a poor measure of body fat on an individual level. The article fails to mention that there are other measures of body fat that are accessible - I've gotten some through my gym.

        "It's rather puzzling how an article on obesity never mentions food. \n\nAmerica creates an industrial food complex after WW2 that is highly caloric and highly processed. And then 80 years later we wonder why people weigh more and then have navelgazing editorials (pun intended) on what to 'call obesity.'\n\nDo we want skinnier, healthier citizens or not? \n\nMaybe we don't because it satisfies Big Food, Big Pharma and all that processed food gives us a dopamine hit that we can't say no to and our new reality is normalizing body shapes like the future humans in Wall-E. \n\nI'd prefer we don't do that and have a healthier society with healthier food. \n\nGetting lost in the gray areas of 'what to call obesity' and how to measure it accurately misses the forest.",

Families resort to fast-food, prepared food, and snacking on high-calorie junk, all of which contributes to the problem. The federal government over time through constant information campaigns helped people quit or not start smoking. Maybe there is a similar role here.

        "Nowhere in this very long piece over whether obesity is a disease, a risk factor or a lack of willpower, does the author mention let alone address the fact that obesity has skyrocketed over recent decades, how in the 70s only a fraction of the country was obese, as opposed to the large proportion of today. What changed since then is obviously not human biology, but the types of foods Americans eat and how they eat them. And the reason for this change is also pretty obvious, that the food that is readily available for Americans to eat has changed. \n\nAnd while the article speaks of obesity as a disease of rich Western countries there is one rich Western country that stands in stark contrast to others. And that is France whose population is in the bottom third group of countries in percent of people who are obese, the rest of the countries in that bottom third are all countries that suffer from acute poverty. \n\nAnd the reason that France, a rich Western country, is among the bottom third group of country sharing obesity rates with countries where people cannot afford food is because of the way the French eat and the type of foods they eat. So clearly obesity is not a disease based on biology similar to actual diseases like diabetes. Instead it is based on lifestyle, based in part on the food culture of the country a person lives in, and the food they decide to eat.",

        "Having worked in a multidisciplinary program for individuals with obesity, here are my thoughts;\nYes the definition is problematic. The effort to better define obesity as an medical condition is important for research and treatment but I fear is driven by providers and pharma desiring insurance reimbursement, and insurers who do not want to pay. \nDefinitely more attention needs to be paid to an environment that promotes the consumption of unhealthy, often addictive, processed foods and makes daily exercise of any kind a challenge. But like the cost of treatment, these factors expose the enormous income disparity in this country where healthy food and daily exercise are increasingly the privilege of the wealthy.\nIdeally we need to better understand the complexity of this condition and individualize treatment, including education and behavior change strategies as well as medical interventions. \nAs a clinician practicing in this area, I have been asked by surgeons who took a weekend seminar in bariatric surgery to \"clear\" individuals for surgery despite the fact that they were poor candidates for a variety of reasons. Many schools have vending machines for junk food and sugary drinks, and unhealthy school lunches. Everybody and their sibling has been on some kind of crazy diet not based in any science.

Many strategies that lower 'weight' appear to be successfully reducing obesity, but in reality the loss of lean tissue results  in adaptive thermogenesis after 4 to 6 months. This causes weight to increase, but the weight increase rebound is more 'fat' weight than 'lean' weight, making the person more obese. Step 1 is to measure body composition rather than weight/height. Step 2 is to reduce meal size, lower refined carb intake, and increase meal frequency to lower the insulin response to eating. Step 3 is to find an activity that is easy to do regularly to sustain lean mass and increase energy expenditure.",

        "When I was a child in the '60s and '70s it was rare to see an obese person. Now it's commonplace. Public health statistics confirm this change. What is to account for it? I suspect it's the ready availability and wide consumption of convenience foods, which are low in fiber and high in sugars, particularly high fructose corn syrup. The author of this essay proposes that those who are not affected by the obesity epidemic have protective generic factors. Could it just be that they are eating whole food diets low in added sugars?",
        "I have a hard time with the idea that being overweight is a function of a disease or genetics and is not within the control of a human. \n\nBut I do see huge portions of food, continual snacking, poor food choices, ignorance of food choices, eating manufactured things that I don't even consider food, excuses, a hideous lack of any exercise. Overweight is just the outcome or perhaps a symptom. It takes 3500 calories to make a pound of fat for anyone -not more for skinny people and not less for fat people. We have 2 ways to address this - eat less or exercise more. You can include drugs if you want to deal with side-effects, but what happens when you lose the weight, and go off the drug? The old habits return, and you are back to gaining weight. Nothing is solved.The answer is to address the problem - why are people overeating and not exercising? Sounds more like an issue for psychotherapy to address. The people I've met who are very obese have a certain way of not taking responsibility for themselves and are very passive.",

        "The thyroid hormone serves as the regulatory mechanism that controls the rate at which mitochondria ( and the body ) burn fuel, just like a thermostat.\n\nThe thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is a commonly used test to assess thyroid function. Its levels exhibit an inverse relationship:\n- In hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels), TSH levels are elevated.\n- In hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone levels), TSH levels are depressed.\nThe normal range for TSH levels in adults typically falls between 0.4 and 4.0 mIU/L (milli-international units per liter). However, recent research suggests that this range may be more appropriate to be between 0.45 and 2.5 mIU/L.\n\nIndividuals who are overweight or obese should strongly advocate with their physicians to monitor their TSH levels (and, if indicated, additional tests). If the TSH levels for such individuals are towards the higher range or higher than normal, a case can be made for thyroid supplementation until the TSH levels are brought down to the lower range limit.\n\nPrescription thyroid supplements, under the supervision of a physician, can assist the body in regulating fuel consumption and body weight. Carefully monitored thyroid supplementation by physicians presents a more economical approach to weight loss compared to the widely used GLP-1 analogues.\n\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists should develop a revised consensus statement on TSH monitoring and the indications for thyroid supplementation.",

For the most part, we're genetically programmed to put on weight; not so much to take it off. Especially since, as hunter-gatherers, most of us were expected to die or be killed by age 45.

        "So, Doctors, after diagnosing people as being obese and in poor health for 30 years, when we suddenly have a cure for that, you all decide that maybe it's not that bad after all.

Poor people will have to PROVE that their obesity is bad for their health, and suddenly Doctor's can't figure that out anymore, despite being quick to do so for 30 years.

        "Many readers have commented on the role of processed food, particularly the excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates (particularly fructose and sucrose), but the author's reference to \"environments that exploit genetic susceptibilities many people have\" is far too obscure. It is astonishing that anyone could write an article about conditions (obesity and type-2 diabetes) that were almost unknown 60 years ago without directly considering the role of the food industry and the incredible degradation of the food supply. The main reason obesity was defined as a disease was because the medical profession had invented profitable treatments, namely surgery and drugs. Doctors have never discussed diet in a meaningful way with their patients, partly because they don't know anything about it. My cousin recently graduated from medical school; she told me that the sum total of her education about nutrition was one hour. The medical \"system\" is not designed to reward keeping patients healthy -- it is essentially designed to ignore the underlying causes of disease and make money treating all the sick people that produces.",

When it was tobacco companies hooking people on nicotine, we came to understand that \u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d is not a good way to think about the issue, because those very corporations were doing everything they could to undermine personal autonomy, to tilt the behavioral field toward encouraging over-consumption.

The resulting glut leads to endemic metabolic syndrome, with increasing insulin resistance, inexorable weight gain, body-wide oxidative stress and all of the more easily catalogued diseases that follow.

The diet could help with weight loss, but I'm also epileptic, which is what it was originally created to help.  So, if I tried the diet and didn't lose weight, it would still potentially be a viable experiment to see if maybe it helped me have fewer epileptic seizures.

And physician reimbursement goes down as we have to treat more of the heart disease and joint failure that is a result of this.

Also, with all due regard for the feelings of individuals, most of those who are obese or overweight are not particularly happy with the appearance of their bodies, so help them to look and feel better. The debate over what to call obesity gets in the way of solutions for people who want to weigh less. The search for drugs and surgeries, which so far have not been shown to be the solution to obesity or long term health and happiness, crowds out behavioral and nutritional solutions which cost less and provide long term success. Focus on helping people with more healthy diets. Focus on less subsidy for Big Food, which daily encourages the epidemic of obesity by aggressively marketing processed foods. Make healthy and organic foods cheaper and more available. Increase labeling transparency and detail. Encourage more local and sustainable food production. Put a tax on unhealthy foods full of sugar, salt and junk fats. Don't we yet have enough evidence for the ineffectiveness of medical fads like bypass surgery, bariatric surgery and \"weight loss drugs,\" to realize that the solution to individual and population health doesn't lie there? Or in debating what to call obesity instead of tackling the problem?",
        "Obesity can\u2019t possibly be a disease because it\u2019s not something that always existed within humans.  However- one could argue that obesity stems from the idea that the animal body is designed to take advantage of food sources when food is otherwise scarce.  For instance:  a pride of lions might go a long period of time without bringing down substantial prey, but when they finally bring down a big animal or more, they will tend to gorge on the bounty.  Humans (for the most part) don\u2019t have to worry about food scarcity, but the biological impulse to gorge on food is still there.  Most people are able to ignore the impulse to eat when they don\u2019t need the food, but others can\u2019t.  Does this mean the people who can\u2019t resist have a disease?  No.  They have a problem resisting a biological impulse.",

They decide based on cost, comparable other drugs, availability, etc.  Just calling obesity a disease won't automatically make insurance companies pay for Ozempic or Wegovy.  For example, my insurance company will not cover Cialis for ED.  But, it will cover it for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  It will cover Ozempic for diabetes but not for obesity.  So, again, who cares if it's classified as a disease other than giving obese people an excuse.",

        "While I am not familiar with the procedures of how opinion news articles are written and presented, I would expect an article that draws heavily from an array of sources spanning institutions, national agenices, and health research such as this one that all of its sources would be cited. I believe it is paramount to be transparent to the audience on the sources in which the arguments and conclusions of an article are based upon, such that the audience is able to access it if desired. This would inform the opinions of readers, allow them to better understand how the author came to their opinion, and enhance the comparison of their thoughts with those of the author. I believe this article should answer to a higher bar regarding the procedures in how information is presented and cited since it is centered on obesity which has an array of information available on it on and this article may very well prompt a reader to start researching it. Not all information on obesity is reliable, and since this is a highly debated topic with differing opinions, I am surprised that the risk of mis- and disinformation seems to have not been considered in this article's publication. For example, in the sentence, \"I learned how encumbered and unwell many people feel under the weight of excess...making it harder to breathe and move, and increasing the risk of other maladies, including type 2 diabetes and several forms of cancers,\" no source is given. This is clearly based on a source. Where is it?",
        "There might not be clear causation, but there is certainly correlation between the high current rates of obesity (no matter how it's defined) and the huge restaurant market share of fast food chains across the country, sugar and salt laden processed food everywhere on grocery store shelves, and the proliferation of soft drinks.

        "I think we each have propensity towards a certain body shape and size that is based on genetics, our relationship with food, the availability of minimally processed foods, and exercise. I think this evaluation has to be at the individual level. Any metric across a large group of people will miss important elements. In other words, every individual (along with their doctor) has to make an honest assessment of what is genetics, what is about food choices, what is about processed foods and what is about exercise. \nWith this said, there were two people in my life who were at unhealthy weights (coupled with unhealthy genetics, poor food habits and little to no exercise). One of these accepted that some of their choices were contributing but was reluctant to make change. The other was adamant that  this is just how their body was and did not feel their choices were contributing in any way. The latter is an unhealthy mindset. People can have genetic predisposition but should not be lulled into thinking their choices are irrelevant. It is one thing to accept risk. Quite another to dismiss it. Like the smoker who says I know it\u2019s bad for me but I don\u2019t want to quit is different from the smoker who denies that smoking is a risk and they should just be accepted for being a smoker and that rules against smoking in public are a personal affront.",

Allergies, always a drag and often deadly, aren't diseases but conditions created by a trigger-happy immune system. The fever that can kill you is part of the body's effort to kill invaders. \n\nObesity fits into this category: not a disease exactly, but a bioliogical response to the environment that is clearly part of a pretty normal genetic make-up, given that a sizeable portion of the population is overweight/obese. Not voluntary (thin people, you are not thin because you eat better; you eat better because you are thin - and by the way, lots of you don't, and lots of fat people eat very well). But also not the sign that the system is grievously malfunctioning - just that it's maladapted to this environment. \n\nThat also explains why obesity, like allergies, would suddenly bloom out of nowhere - also why not *everyone* is obese, just as not everyone gets allergies. When almost no one has enough food, very few people will discover their genetic predisposition to obesity (though some will). When we're drowning in the stuff, more and more will.",

        "I think most of us intuitively understand that if we exercised a bit more, ate a bit better, and lost a few pounds, our health would be better.  We would be less at risk for some major diseases, less likely to die when we do get sick (of COVID-19, for example), and less subject to wear and tear that causes pain in old age (arthritis, joint replacements, and so on).  We know that's true.  And yet there is an interest in endlessly muddying the waters... \"Well, some people who are fat aren't really unhealthy... and some who look skinny are secretly fat... and what if we stigmatize and demoralize the obese...\" and on and on.\n\nThis reminds me of when the COVID-19 vaccines were made available and the CDC issued new guidance about masks.  They listed twelve different activities and showed a risk assessment and a recommendation for whether to mask for each one, first for unvaccinated people, then for vaccinated.  The takeaway of the graphic was absolutely unclear.  All of the vaccinated squares were colored green, meaning \"safest,\" but many of them still showed an icon wearing a mask, even for outdoor activities - raising the question of just how safe they ought to be considered.  It was completely overwhelmed the message of the graphic - that if you're vaccinated, you are basically safe to resume your normal life. \n (The graphic was soon revised.)

Others are related to specific causes: smoking, alcohol, exposure to toxins through work or even from mass exposure through spraying toxic chemicals. Such things vary enormously, and are not binary.\n\nThe threats of obesity vary greatly from one person to another.

I happened to carry my weight well (or so I was told on many occasions).  If you don't carry you're weight well, yeah, do something.\n\nI could have saved myself bariatric surgery and all the attendant losses (muscle mass, etc.) if I could have slowed down my eating--taking, say, 30 minutes to eat a plate of food instead of ten (which gave me time to get more before my stomach signaled my brain that I was full).",

It encourages looking at health markers and actions besides weight e.g. knowing a big body doesn\u2019t preclude exercise and having fun.

        "Obesity is best considered a \"metabolic disorder\" where a normal physiological condition is \"out side the norm\". Diseases typically have a known cause. Obesity and type 2 diabetes have complex etiologies that vary depending on the person. Consequently, as the article points out, there aren't reliable diagnostics. Much of the research has erroneously relied on BMI and needs to be redone. We do know some facts: 1.  The variance in the etiology of obesity is based on population genetics. 2. There are several different subtypes of obesity based on physiological variances. So there will be no \"silver bullet\". 3. \"Lifestyle adjustments\" are essential, but not sufficient unto themselves to \"cure\" obesity for everyone. 4. The American food supply is toxic, loaded with added sugars that are often excessive and even unnecessary. We need a public information campaign for healthier diets that start with reducing added sugars. 5. There is much more to do in terms of research and public information about \"obesity\".",

She got cancer because she was unlucky. \n\nBut some people still had the emotional need to attribute her illness to some kind of character flaw. My own take on this need to blame is that it comes from two places: First, many people want to feel in control of their health\u2014that they can avoid illness simply by making all the right choices. Second, some people just need to feel superior. \n\nAs someone who was born with multiple heart defects, I laugh at the idea that anyone is in control of their health. Not sure what I could have done as a fetus to keep my aortic valve from prolapsing or to close the hole between my ventricles. Maybe I was lazy and didn't kick enough in the womb? Or my mom ate the wrong foods and therefore she's to blame?\n\nLife is complex. Avoid taking credit, avoid assigning blame\u2014and remember, in all cases of misfortune, \"There but for the grace of god go I.\" Have compassion. It really could be you, no matter how in control you like to think you are.",
        "Eating habits plus a sedentary lifestyle are the main contributors to obesity, in my opinion. As a child my mother taught me good eating habits. Obesity does run on my Dad's side of the family. Sometimes I was not allowed to have the extra snack I wanted and had to wait until dinner. We ate well-balanced homecooked meals and ate out only occasionally. Soda and sugary treats were part of our diets but only on a limited basis. All three of us kids are normal weight now which is a blessing as we're in our mid to late 60's. A close friend of mine and her sister were both obese. Her parents and brother were not, and I noticed her parents were always encouraging the girls to eat more and were concerned that I would eat a smaller portion. Once you are obese, it is definitely very hard to lose the weight. We should be focusing on keeping people at a healthy weight if at all possible.",

Massively processed food, portion sizes, personal computing leading to reduced activity starting in childhood, etc. It\u2019s not a disease. It\u2019s a product of the times we live in.

It\u2019s a genetic fat and lymph disorder which makes it nearly impossible to lose weight by any means or lifestyle changes. Lipodema is also resistant to weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegpvy.

Endocrinologist Robert Lustig and many others are very clear that the single biggest contributors to the metabolic diseases that typically plague obese people, but can also occur in \u201cthin fat\u201d people are processed food, particularly those that are high sugar, with high fructose being particularly unhealthy.  Large food companies have engineered foods to make them addictive and big pharma has avidly embraced a disease model that puts incredibly expensive treatments ahead of much cheaper and healthier prevention. \n\nPharmaceutical treatments partially mitigate the harms, while creating some negative side effects.  Prevention prevents all of the harms for many people creating a whole range of physical and psychological benefits at minimal to no cost to society.  It won\u2019t eliminate the need for (imperfect) treatments, but it could greatly reduce it.",

        "Congratulations! You included the word \"prevention\" in your essay. Only once, but still better than others. Yet not as often as the word \"treat\" or \"treatment.\" (I counted 13 of these).\n\nIf we want to stop the ever-increasing health care costs that are eating more and more out of our wealth we need to have doctors that heal. Yes, you read that right. All medicines have side-effects. Some side-effects get worse over time.",
        "A lot of ink over a problem that mostly results from the fact that we evolved in an envoriment that rewarded eating as much fats and calories dense foods as we could. It was just hard to find calories until recently and we burned up a lot of calories looking for food. So, genetically, most of us are prone to obesity. Accept that. Learn how to avoid calorie dense foods. It is not easy, but it is doable, with time, effort, education and maybe even training. TV advertisements for sure make those high calories foods appealing but knowing they are playing to our genectic predispositions, helps to resist them. Too bad we can not teach kids in school how advertisers try to get us to buy their products.",
        "I have a sneaking suspicion that this proposed methodology is meant to suppress the use of weight loss medications. By requiring a much more convoluted and stringent method of measuring \"bad\" body fat, combined with the requirement that the patient already have a second disease, the insurance industry would be releaved of covering these expensive drugs. \n\nFor example, a pre-diabetic would not have access until fully diabetic, and then only if the body fat profile fit the new, extremely limiting standards.",
        "I think calling obesity a disease is an easy cop out for most of the obese.  Are there a very small percentage of people with a genetic disorder that leads to obesity:  yes.  Also, a number of drug therapies for a wide range of ailments can cause obesity as it messes with your hormones.\n\nHowever, for most people, it is bad choices alone.  Stop eating so much, get out and really exercise regularly, and mind what you are eating (whether it's munchies, over processed foods, or sweets).\n\nI have more sympathy for the poor who frequently lack the time to prepare fresh foods, don't have access to affordable good food choices, and/or lack knowledge of good diets.  The middle and upper class epidemic in obesity, though, is about bad choices.  Don't let them off the hook.\n\nIf you call it a disease, you give the vast majority an excuse to continue their unhealthy lifestyles and their solution will be yet another drug that may have other side effects.  \n\nIn sum, be careful about fat shaming all, but there is nothing beautiful about people too lazy to take care of themselves.",

Then I lost about 15% of my body weight during the Covid lockdowns because I wasn't drinking alcohol or eating restaurant food.  I cut my eating down to a couple of small meals.  I wasn't hungry either.  Then I regained the weight as things opened back up and I started eating out again.  Now I'm on an off-label version of these Ozempic-like drugs, and I simply don't want to eat more than a few bites at a time.  The appetite suppression has helped me to take the weight off again.  I'm perfectly willing to take these drugs forever to keep the weight off, but I also know now what portion sizes and kinds of foods I need to be eating now.

        "Think back to the 1970s, if you were around then. With TV, you maybe had four useful channels at best. If you wanted to see a movie, you went out, usually with friends, to the movie theater. If you wanted to eat out quickly and cheaply, there was the occasional McDonalds and a couple of other chains, but even Burger King was slightly exotic. Junk food, as I recall, was more or less limited to potato chips.  \n\nThe obesity \u201cepidemic\u201d started in the early 1980s as a result of the explosion of cheap fast food and junk food at the same time as new technologies like VCRs, cable TV, personal computers, and home gaming systems meant you never had to leave your sofa to be entertained.  Both problems have only compounded themselves exponentially then. And let\u2019s not forget the obliteration of steady, well-paying manufacturing jobs in much of the country, along with an increasing expectation of 24/7 work if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a white-collar job. Try cooking a well-balanced, nutritious meal for your kids when it\u2019s cheaper to buy fast food or you regularly get home from work at 10:00 pm. \n\nSo, yeah, thinking of obesity as a medical disease was never terribly accurate.",

Historically, obesity was rare (Roman vomitorium), and the ancient world was 1/2 slave and scarcity predominated. Breakfast was invented 200 years ago for the British gentry and regular eating was seasonal.  General US Grant memoir introduced circa 1890's Army food strategy and by WWI behind the line kitchens.  By WWII, axis and allies had 3 meals a day standard for war making.  Circa (global) obesity was ~10% but near zero morbid conditions.

        "\"Obesity\" is probably not best thought of as a disease. It might be more useful to think of obesity (however it is operationalized) as a \"syndrome\" in the technical sense of this term. That is, the etiology of its expressions is complex, unclear, and varied--so much so that no single analysis is adequate to explain it at a population level and so cannot serve as the basis for effective social interventions. \n\nObesity is an effect of lots of conditions and factors--social and biological and genetic-- and actions and behaviors. Most recently, some have wanted to, in line with the zeitgeist of the moment, eliminate the consideration of behavioral factors. Others are seeking solely genetic or physiological factors. None of these uni-dimensional (often doctrinaire) approaches will provide a sufficient path forward because they exclude a wide range of conditions and causes. \n\nThis common sense interpretation runs afoul of many other commonsense assumptions and beliefs so it cannot gain traction. \nThere is no single, secret solution at a societal or individual level no matter how much we want that and unwittingly \"believe\" it must be the case. \n\nThere are both shallow and deep reasons why this is the case, but as this author is trying to do, the very way we think about the construct of \"obesity\" must be recast. Of course, the question is how, precisely. I am doubtful that  the forces shaping the discourse on this topic are capable of providing the nuance needed. You are on your own.",

Please, take what the writer says to heart:  we still don\u2019t have enough scientific understanding of obesity to label it a disease, regardless of the countless opinions of its causes and treatments.  I agree that diets have changed since the 1980s, but that doesn\u2019t explain everything.  There are so many other interconnected factors in play that it is an experimental design nightmare to isolate anything resembling cause and effect.  As with most complex problems, there is nothing as obvious as what some seem to think.  I\u2019m just encouraged that there are scientists and clinicians trying to figure this out.  In the meantime, we can only do what we can to stay relatively healthy and minimize known risk factors: eat right, exercise, don\u2019t smoke, limit alcohol, etc.",
        "It seems obvious that obesity is multifactorial: genetic predispositions in most obese people coupled  with social and psychological determinants.  Like many diseases.\n\nThe debunking of BMI is rather absurd: very few people are so muscled that the BMI is seriously distorted: just LOOK at the patient as well. \n\nIf you want to quibble about BMIs in the just overweight range((25-30:) fine. The BMI parameters in pediatric seem much too strict. But people with BMIs over 35 are clearly very obese and at risk for all the medical complications of obesity. Even if at one point in time, a person with a BMI has normal blood pressure, cholesterol and HgbA1C\u2026 those parameters will not remain so if the person remains obese. And the knees: ouch! Lots of knee replacements for high risk people down the road. (of course non-obese people may need knee replacements as well, but one cannot deny the stress such weight puts on weight bearing joints)\n\nSome people need medication to get their weight down, some benefit from bariatric surgery and others manage their weight with diet and exercise: whatever works.

        "I see obesity as a symptom of a larger medical issue rather than a disease.\n\nIn my experience, two major things cause it: 1) addiction to food (overeating) or 2) a metabolic disorder.\n\nAddiction to overeating is a lifetime struggle. I can speak for myself that I have and sometimes still struggle with overeating, but can happily say that I've gotten myself down to a good weight and have maintained it for two years now. I've also put on a decent amount of muscle in my mid-30s; something I hope to maintain for the rest of my life. \n\nI can speak for a loved one of mine who despite watching what she ate and how much she exercised, she couldn't lose weight like I could. She needed to turn to a keto diet which almost killed her via starvation ketoacidosis.\n\nIt turns out she fell into the second category and was recently diagnosed with PCOS with insulin resistance. To put it very simply, her body refuses to use glucose properly and stores it as fat instead of using it. Her doctor has prescribed her a GLP-1 as she has other patients with the same condition and they have seen life-changing improvements to their health with that medicine. My hope is that she sees the same outcome too.",
        "In general the BMI index is more of a \"ballpark\" measurement of how you are doing with regard to weight.  Body type, physical exercise, genetics are all factors in your health in addition to weight.  However, we all know that carrying too much weight adds risk to your health and visits to the doctor will let you know if you are at risk.  Frankly, if you eat healthy foods in reasonable amounts, exercise regularly and sleep well your body weight will be at a normal level.",
        "The true cause of obesity has not yet been discovered. That it is of recent development is perhaps a clue. We blame the processed foods and sugary drinks, but perhaps they are just responding to demand.

        "While BMI may be an imperfect correlate for \"disease,\" as a health care practitioner I don't think it's irrelevant and useless.  For many people with BMI's in the 30-35 range, body type and muscle mass are factors in defining whether it's \"obesity.\"  But generally speaking as one moves along the spectrum to BMI's of 40, 50 or even greater it's clearer that it can be called obesity. Finally when someone has organ dysfunction (cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, autoimmune disorders, and perhaps most importantly can't do normal activities of day to day life) I think it's clearer that obesity is a disease and those people should be eligible for treatments.  What that treatment should be is still debatable despite the apparent effectiveness of the new drugs like Ozempic, etc as long term use of any drug in potentially millions of people can take many years to define adverse consequences.  In the shorter term, however, they can be powerful for reducing weight.  It's likely that a multi pronged treatment regimen would be best.  I'm not opposed if a better marker than BMI and definition of obesity and disease are found and put into practice but the reality in health care is often things are not black and white but require some degree of nuance and thought.  For now, however, I think BMI in the context of an individual patient and their circumstances is still useful.",

No doubt this added to the death toll but the was undercounted as an issue as doctors just ignored the effect it had on the body.\n\nAs far as sun exposure, we recommend everyone wear sun screen.

My days of starving are over, since finally the blood work and the genetic testing were ordered.  \n\nSo, I appreciate your essay...but I suggest bloodwork needs to be done much earlier in childhood. One of my genetic variations is estimated to affect 40% of the population...the work on Vitamin D (a hormone)  and  its measurement needs to be finished. Talk to an oncologist...surely we can agree that circulating vitamin D in single digits is of concern, and the patient should know about it early in adulthood.  I'm lucky, my child's doctor listened to my history and ordered the bloodwork so child is getting the supplement needed. My other variation is in the methylation cycle, can't eat my way out of it and by the time I was diagnosed the supplement was on the market.  At pennies per day, the body now doesn't need to be overeating, desperately trying to get the missing nutrients from food.  Labwork and first pass genetics is a small cost.",
        "One pound of fat is approximately equivalent to 3,500 calories - to lose a pound of fat a week create a caloric deficit of around 500 calories a day. The safest way is to reduce consumption and step up exercise, do both. Everything in moderation. Consult with a doctor before embarking on any weight loss program. This is a proven method to lose fat, is it easy? No. Is it achievable? Yes.",

        "To use government dollars to subsidize food that is making us sick, and then use those same government dollars to pay for drugs that we don\u2019t know the long term affects of, to ward off the effects of the food, sounds like the plot of a terrible dystopian novel.

        "I am an obese but metabolically healthy senior citizen who at a recent colonoscopy was classified by whatever the criteria are that anesthesiologists use as grade 3 -- \"serious systemic disease\" with \"substantive functional limitations.\" This puts my obesity in the same class as COPD, alcoholism, hepatitis, and other diseases. This despite the fact that I am not diabetic, I do not have hypertension, I do not have elevated cholesterol, I walk without difficulty with just mild knee arthritis consistent with my age, I do tai chi and qigong 3-4 times a week, and I drag my trash cans up and down a 100' hill every week. I take ONE medication for my thyroid.\n\nDoes that sound like \"severe functional limitations\"?",

It is not an indicator of health. Denmark is right about the damaging effect of stigma.",
        "The ceaseless distractions of our modern lives as we multi-task through our day, glued to our phones, perhaps causes us to ignore or diminish subtle messages from our physicality.

Decades ago \u2013 drags in a heavy cart representing how much weight she lost.\n2. Gains weight back and declares there is nothing wrong with being big. That's just the way she is.\n3. Goes on Ozempic, loses a lot of weight, and declares obesity a disease, based on unknown credentials.",
        "I believe, dear writer, that you are over complicating this needlessly.\n\nThe disease we are dealing with is one of a very bad food supply that is addictive, overly processed, and  too high in animal products.\n\nToday\u2019s food is relatively new, but our brains are very old.\n\nLike all other animals, humans have exquisite satiety circuitry designed to tell a person when he or she has had enough to eat. When a person is eating natural foods that they were designed to eat, it\u2019s nearly impossible to gain weight, even if one is genetically predisposed to do so from having ancestors who endured starvation \u2014those efficiency genes are very adaptive in times of scarcity.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to become obese on strawberries, whole grains, kale, and other whole natural plant foods loaded with fiber.\n\n(I suppose if one perversely ate cashews all day then obesity would be an outcome along with malnutrition)\n\nHowever, our food supply has tricked nearly all of us into eating way too few of the above health-promoting foods,  addicting us to foods unnaturally high in energy density, sweet foods, foods loaded with saturated fats, and salty, oily concoctions. All of these things are wonderful if you\u2019re not doing so well and you\u2019re hungry. But it isn\u2019t natural for us to have so much of it at breakfast lunch and dinner.\n\nThe disease we are talking about is bad food and way too much of it and addiction to those bad foods. It is mostly not a genetic matter.  Genes don\u2019t change that quickly.",
        "Years ago, my wife used to make me watch Oprah - maybe as a test of my affection for her, it's hard to say. Our relationship survived the test.\n\nAs one of her guests, Oprah had invited Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for the NY Times and an accomplished writer of several books. It was a 2-part interview. \n\nPollen was an articulate and intelligent guest, with many good ideas about how people could improve their eating habits. \n\nAt the end of the first hour, Oprah looked into the camera and gushed \"This has been great. We've learned so much in the past hour. Tune in tomorrow for the second part of our interview with Michael Pollan.\"\n\nThe TV then flashed to an ad for a drug that dealt with acid reflux, which is nature's way of saying to a person who has ingested foods that are a bad choice \"Hey, please don't feed me this junk, it's making me sick.\"\n\nWhat Oprah should have said at the end of her first hour of interview with Michael Pollan might have consisted of the following: \"Tune in again tomorrow, but brace yourself in between for the next 23 hours of programming that leads you in the wrong direction.\"",
        "interesting that the author makes mention of the rise in obesity from the 1980s due the 'environmental factors' instead of the very obvious glaring cause: the rise of big food.\n\nthe current foods in our pantry are so different than they were before the 80s. yes, we had chips and junk food, but those werent in giant bags with extreme colors and a list of unpronouncable ingredients a mile long.\n\nwe didnt have advertisements every five minutes in those same bright colors showing the glory of a big delicious burger or stack of pancakes that were continually marketed to us. (marketing 101, the more you see something, the more you want it) the marketing extremes of cheese in the 80s due to farmer excess is a huge casestudy on how certain foods have been pushed to consumers via marketing.\n\nthe way we eat has changed. how we chose our food has changed. the foods we eat have changed. all majorly contribute to the rise in obesity. not to mention the decline in activity, the morph into screens and becoming screen people, what upcs are shown to do to the body, etc etc.\n\nTHAT is the major cause of obesity since the 80s. dont sugarcoat it with 'environmental issues'. that just lets big food off the hook.",
        "I see overeating as an addiction, not obesity as a disease.",
        "I see obesity happening from two key factors in our modern day. The first is the quality of the food. Most food is way too over processed, full of sugar and sugar substitutes, oils, fats, preservatives and so on. There is too much meat and deep-fried food, as well as treats and drinks of all sorts. Most people fill up their stomachs as much as their gas tanks when they stop for gas. Corporations and restaurants add these things to get you addicted to them.\n\nAnd this is the segway to the 2nd factor - that of addiction. Culturally we are running around in a fast paced, frantic, and almost manic state, unable to calm enough to enjoy the moment. That sort of dysfunction leads right into addictions because the mind is not able to settle to find it's calm, so it tries to fill itself with whatever short-term gratification it can grasp. \n\nThere is another way. Practice mindfulness. Meditation is a great boost, but just becoming aware of yourself, your body, breathing, and your bodies urges. If you truly listen to your body and get settled within it, your body knows exactly what foods to consume and which to stay away from. It is the easiest way of weight control among benefits in every aspect of life.",
        "Good reminder.  It make sense to me that BMI is like other metrics such as blood pressure and cholesterol that when too high signify disease.  Like other chronic health problems, the underlying causes are complex.  For Americans, our culture presents us with a host of obesity inducing foods. Our culture also has mostly eliminated physical work in everyday life.  There are also clear inborn differences among individuals and among world populations in the propensity to become obese and suffer the consequent maladies.",
        "To explain the link between poverty and obesity, it's best to study West Virginia.\n\nW.V. is 97% white, which takes racism out of the equation.\n\n1.  Poverty:  West Virginia has the lowest median household income in the country.\n\n2.  Obesity:  West Virginia leads the nation in adult obesity, and is 2nd in the nation in child obesity.\n\n3.  There are 40 Walmarts in West Virginia.\n\n4.  A variety of quick-cook  microwaveable-in-package frozen vegetables are currently in stock at Walmarts in West Virginia for $1.50 per pound\n\n5.  Walmarts offers freezers for $150 and microwaves for $75.\n\n6.  West Virginia has tons of open spaces for kids to get exercise, and spaces outside to put the freezer under a sheet of old plywood.\n\nSo, in West Virginia, capitalism has provided plentiful, inexpensive, quick,  easy-to-cook nourishing vegetables--plus, inexpensive devices to store them and cook them.\n\nYet they lead the nation in obesity.\n\nMy son responded to the W. Va. obesity situation  by stating that food corporations have brainwashed people into eating bad food.\n\nI replied that it's human nature to crave sugar, salt, and fat.  You don't have to be brainwashed. \n\nIn my opinion, in W. Va. obesity is cultural; not structural.  It takes a strong cultural push to reach for the frozen bag of broccoli instead of the bag of delicious salty Doritos.",
        "Central to the problem, as it is with other medical obsessions, is the idea that people can be treated as standardized objects. Deviations from these standards condemns the afflicted to a sentence of life-altering medication imposing a harm of its own. Everyone must have the same blood sugar, pressure, bmi and so forth. And the individual variations of physiology are brushed aside, as are patients complaints when their bodies rebel at what is being done to their regulatory mechanisms. And these lifetime medication programs are very profitable for the industry. Perhaps why the 'standards' are regularly revised downward with corresponding increase in potential patient pools.\n\nAre all of these 'diseases' actually a problem? Perhaps. But the actual mechanisms still appear unknown. And the treatments just address some of the 'symptoms'. Whether this helps or harms the patient is just not important enough."
