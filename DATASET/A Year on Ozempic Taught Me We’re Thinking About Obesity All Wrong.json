        "The problem with \"processed\" food is most contain lots of sugar. I lost my heavy weight over 10 years as my body sugar slowly reduced to where I no longer feel the constant lows and highs of sugar. You have to really get away from fast food and processed grocery foods and that is very hard as these foods are cheap and quick. My one crutch is sugar substitutes which I know aren't the best to use and I am sure there are side effects with the new drugs but attacking the need for food is progress and if you are obese these drugs can be a life changer. \nThe article didn't mention exercise as doctors suggest 70% of your weight loss should come from diet and 30% from exercise and activity. I do exercise and without it I don't think I would have been successful.",
        "If the problem is ultra processed or \u201cbad\u201d foods, perhaps more people should start learning to cook at an early age. It needn\u2019t be time consuming, plenty of recipes that take maybe 30 minutes.",
        "Just a stunning lack of empathy and open mindedness  in many of these comments. The author discusses satiety in a reasoned way, amongst other good points, and many commenters respond with, \u201cpeople choose to be fat\u201d and variations thereon. I\u2019m guessing many folks skimmed the article, saw their pet prejudices called into question, and skipped right to the comments section. Very MAGA-ish, me thinks.",
        "Who has the leisure time to shop and cook?  Seriously.  A typical working person is so harassed by the effort of getting to and fro in a typical day that even the most motivated will grab what is convenient over what is most healthy most of the time.  No wonder that the food industry overwhelmingly labels things \"fresh\" and \"healthy\" and \"high protein\" and the like, even though the products in question are anything but.  They are trying to assuage guilt!  My great grandmother cooked every single thing she ate (except stuff from the bakery).  She is the last generation in my family to have done so.  Every other woman worked and, in the 60's, when I was a kid, it was \"hello Swansons.\"",
        "If there's one thing I can probably count on it's that I'll be dead (and probably fat) before anything changes. May as well eat the cheesecake.",
        "Nice piece. Thank you for writing it.",
        "Put pencil to paper and create a family genogram  looking at body size from one generation to the next. You will likely find some answers. \nWe take medicines for all of our ailments and predispositions, why not for weight?",
        "Thank you for this!  The community at Obesity Action Coalition (obesity action.org). Is all about access to care (of all varieties), support, and advocacy - hope you connect!  \n\nIgnore the trolls - this is the last bastion of open discrimination.  (Including helpful \"frenemies\")",
        "I think you're wrong that processed foods always cause people to become overweight.  Some of us have a natural \"off\" switch, no matter what we are eating.  It appears obese people's brains take longer to activate this stop-eating command.  This is what the scientist means by satiation signal.  The weight-loss drugs simply bring the signal more in line with what non-obese people experience.  I think you are incorrect to blame the food that's available, vs. how your own brain differs from the brain of a naturally thin person.",
        "Whatever it takes.",
        "I'm 64 years old.  I don't have a spouse and I don't have children.  I'm fairly healthy now, but I do worry about the future.      Fear of losing my mobility and my independence (which will happen) keeps me on a somewhat-healthy diet.",
        "A nutritionist told me years ago: \n\nFiber Fat and Fluid make you Feel Full.  \n\nThis little mantra doesn't address all facets of weight and health, but it has helped me create satiating meals for myself that are the foundation of my well being. \n\nAlso, taking 2-3 hours on a Sunday evening to make a bunch of healthy food that I use all week has solved my \"cooking all the time\" problem. I can stray a bit, but I know I have good food at home. \n\nI know every one is different, but these tips helped me a lot so I thought I'd pass them along",
        "It's interesting here to note the parallels between his experience and addiction. If the food itself is addictive and dangerous, yet the person cannot stop from continuing to alter their diet - then how is that not an addiction? \n\nFor example in this paragraph - \n\n\"But the kind of food I grew up eating, much of which is made in factories, often with artificial chemicals, left me feeling empty and as if I had a hole in my stomach.\"  Replace the word food with, \"alcohol\" and it's obvious. Why didn't the writer change their diet?\n\nBecause they were addicted.",
        "Good article. I know, from my own experience, that if I have a choice between, let's say, some candy or a piece of fresh fruit, the candy will win every time (I'm like those lab rats, sadly). \n\nPart of the trouble I have with fruit is that it just does not taste that good. It is picked underripe, meaning it has little -- or no -- flavor. Sure, I can let it sit on the counter, but all that does it make it \"softer\", not sweeter.",
        "Many Americans eats a regular diet of fast food (double cheeseburgers, large fries and large soda); large portions in restaurants of high calorie meals; snacks & sodas while sitting in front of the tv for hours. \n\nThis is a radical dietary change for most Americans over the last generation. Taste buds get used to high salt/sugar & the stomach gets used to large portions. We humans develop unhealthy eating habits. \n\nOzempic & the other drugs have proven that fewer calories result in significant weight loss for most people. We all must eat to live. We don't have to consume so many calories.",
        "I feel no shame, nor am I doing something immoral. I feel no remorse for something that helps me be present for myself and my family. \n\nI am a non-obese T2D who is on a strength/cardio routine, low-carb/high protein diet, and on Oz. I have to work extra hard to keep my A1C in control due to genetics (Southeast Asian/Pacific Islander; and refer to <a href=\"https://aadi.joslin.org/en/screen-at-23\" target=\"_blank\">https://aadi.joslin.org/en/screen-at-23</a>). Someone further down mentioned Latinos and Asians, and their relationship with rice. For me, I have given up rice, aside from the sushi that I may pick up as \"fast food\" as an alternative to regular fast food when I am crunched for time. However, since my sushi consumption is infrequent, it has been a non-issue overall. \n\nAnyway, whenever there is a high-tide wave of conversations revolving around GLP-1's, I always hold my breath when I request a refill. Then I finally breathe a sigh of relief when it is \"ready for pickup\" hours later. I have this nagging feeling there will be a rush towards these medications because someone famous, like Oprah, is talking about them. Or in this case, a new book about one journalist's experience. There are days where I wish I could have just stayed on Metformin, but with T2D as a progressive disease, I now have to take both. So every time I am alerted for refill on MyChart, I push that button with baited breath.",
        "Well it\u2019s not surprising that something as fundamental as food has been subjected to technology in order to make it more appealing to us. Here I am sitting on a prescription for one of these drugs, about to pull the trigger and finally get my weight under control (I hope.) The problem is that I enjoy eating, drinking and this will make me not interested as much anymore. Therein lies the dilemma. Also it\u2019s crazy expensive, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cheating.",
        "I have wondered why there is not a reverse mechanism on the use of pot.  I remember having the \"screaming eaties\" and scarfed down everything within sight.  What triggers an appetite with the use of pot. Does Ozempic works on satiety in the reverse manner?   Curious minds want to know.  Thanks.",
        "Another article that totally misses the point. Discipline. Personal choices. Taking ownership of your life. Your body. That means you are actively engaged in personal responsibility for your health and risks. You take your car in for a check-up so it doesn't crash and burn, and make (hopefully) good decisions about keeping safe. Why do people who are obese choose food that is clearly going to add to all the health problems they clearly know about by now? I'm tired of all this passing the buck. It is each and every person's personal decision to be fat or not fat with some exceptions. But the majority of obesity articles focus on everything other than a lifelong commitment to exercising, healthy meal choices and discipline.",
        "I wonder about the rat experiment. I believe the results, but I wonder what would happen if the rats were given other unfamiliar foods? I had a dog that had stomach surgery, and was on a bland diet while he recovered - which for dogs means white rice and boiled chicken. My dog adored the chicken and rice, and was not particularly interested in going back to his previous diet of wet and dry dog food; as with the rats, once he was hungry enough he ate what he was given - the only difference is that he was transitioned from chicken and rice back to dog food over the course of several days rather than all at once.\n\nI don't disagree about any of the other concepts presented in the article. Certainly, ultraprocessed foods tend to be high in flavor and low in fiber and protein - the two macro nutrients known to increase satiety - and it's therefore easy to eat a greater number of calories more quickly than with food prepared from raw and minimally-processed ingredients. Then, too, when I cook from scratch, I tend to eat more slowly, with greater attention to what I'm eating, than when I'm eating something that only needs to be heated.\n\nThe issues around ultraprocessed foods are many and complex. Access to fresh food - requiring access to a reasonably close store, and the ability to both pay for and transport fresh food - is lacking for many people, as is access to proper cooking facilities and the time and knowledge to use them. Those issues are just the barest tip of the problem.",
        "We should not be celebrating obesity.  \"I'm a 300-pound celebrity and I'm beautiful,\" helps no one, particularly young people who struggle with weight and diabetes.",
        "For the caveman salt, fat, and high calorie carbs were hard to come by, but essential for their survival. Genetics evolved a craving for those foods so that our long ago ancestors would stuff themselves when the rare opportunity for eating them presented itself. Now that they are readily available it will probably take a few hundred thousand years more for evolution to dispense with a no longer needed genetic trait.",
        "\"Satiety comes late, if at all.\"  Certainly this is true for me, or was until I changed how I eat. I now skip almost all processed foods except some low sugar, high fiber prepared cereals and whole grain crackers. I occasionally eat whole grain bread.  I focus on whole grains, vegetables, fish, eggs, fruit and nuts/seeds. I limit salt and sugar. In a little over one year, I lost 35 pounds without the aid of any drug. No diet, just intelligent eating. \n\nI have eaten a sliver of cake a mere four times in the past year and I ate one scoop of ice cream for the first time in two or three years this weekend at a family celebration.  I really don't miss junk food. \n\nI realize this won't work for everyone, but it did work for me, even though I am in my mid 70s and added only a modest amount of exercise.",
        "Until we can find means to reprogram people to be sated with healthier food, drugs like Ozempic are the only choice.  The problem that I see is that drug companies will not be interested in research to produce drugs or therapies that will reset that cheesecake mode back to natural mode  \n\nFat shaming is horrible and the guilt that the obese feel is even worse.  I see people who have somehow lost the means to naturally regulate their dietary intake.  That's very sad because it unfairly dooms them to an unhealthy life.  It's so obvious that  it's not their fault.  The experiments sure point to a process that is not easily reversible.   Maybe it's impossible without drugs or ???.",
        "\"He was horrified to see that almost everything I ate was reheated and heavily processed.\" Sorry, but using the passive voice doesn't give you a free pass. As the writer of this well written, thoughtful article, it's kinda baffling that Johann hasn't figured out by now how to eat healthy, real, non-processed food. For all the lamenting about the UHPF industrial complex, there are still farmers markets, venues for finding organic grass fed meet and no one is being forced to eat snickers bars (passive back at you!). The 70% need to read up on how to buy, prepare and eat real food. It's not that difficult. Maybe if they stop funding our toxic food system, it'll go bankrupt.",
        "An important fact not mentioned in the article or in the comments section (thank you so much, anecdata experts) is that once the average person gets to an overweight or obese  point, a set point is established and losing weight and keeping it off becomes an almost impossible task, regardless of what they eat. \n\nI grew up in the low-fat craze of the 80s and 90s where all fat was replaced by sugar so that people would eat it. Not the best idea, but I was a child and had no control over what food was provided. And my parents thought they were doing the right thing. So, I\u2019ve been overweight since my early teens. I\u2019ve tried everything: giving up carbs, no ultra-processed food, tried cooking at home, vegetarian, exercising heavily every day, walking every day, basically everything prescribed by our experts here in the comments. None of it worked long-term. Regardless of what I ate or what I did or how much I worked out, I was always hungry and didn\u2019t lose weight. My body was trying to get back to my highest weight set point.\n\nKnow what has worked? These drugs. I think they are wonderful and am glad they help so many people. \n\nAnd for those that don\u2019t need them, great. It will be easier for those that do need them to get them.",
        "I've been on Ozempic for 16 months. I am on low dose. I eat less more slowly and enjoy the food more. I have lost 65lbs. I rarely craze food at all. I am healthier blood pressure down and feel great fir a 76yo.",
        "I ended up prediabetic in my 60's after a slow weight gain of 20 pounds. The thing is I did eat fresh food, home cooked. By American standards I ate few sweets, no soda, whole grain everything. It still wasn't enough, even though there is no family history of diabetes. After I went on metformin and ate low carb it turned around. I lost 20 pounds easily. Hunger nearly vanished. Fatigue after eating vanished. \n\nI didn't exercise enough also - but that's hard with a full time desk job. \n\nI think our American diet and lifestyle is so unhealthy that it produces these metabolic disorders by default. \n\nReducing my carbs has caused me conflict with much advice given to prediabetics -- eat brown rice, whole oats, etc. It was still too much carbs. I think we need to really reduce carb intake in our diet, even healthy carbs.",
        "I would like to see if the rat experiment has been repeated, this time with traditional rich foods and not the ultra processed variety.\nFor example, does a diet prepared from flour, eggs, butter and honey to hit the sweet and fatty spot also lead to weight gain and later rejection of rat chow? That might show the villain is not the vague term ultra processed but rising wealth that has made food available that was once too expensive to eat every day",
        "I think we are also fighting boredom from our jobs. When I'm at work, all I want to do is eat. I rarely think about eating at home except at meal times. At work, I think about food all day long.",
        "Thanks for this more balanced explanation of why the US has gotten so overweight compared to other countries.  Once those countries take on our food model, they also gain weight. I find this explanation immensely more palatable than the current in vogue explanation that we can explain our weight gains by our genetics. This blindly ignores the rest of the world and where our ancestors originated from.",
        "I'm a bit shocked that this writer boils it all down to satiety. Clinical studies of the different GLP--1s show that yes, for a subset of people who have a relatively normal endocrine system, they work by reducing appetite and making people eat less. \n\nHOWEVER - for all the people out there with completely dysfunctional endocrine systems and insulin resistance, the GLP-1s work on a whole other level, i.e. returning their bodies to a state in which (for example) eating any type of carb no longer causes weight gain. These are the people who can't go off the GLP-1s, because their bodies then return to that dysfunctional state. All of this has been shown in actual research studies on these drugs.",
        "Wow, the stream of \"just use willpower\" comments is truly sad and indicative how large the ignorance is bliss class is in this country.\n\nYes, there is some personal responsibility content to it, too.  But I think these \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" folks are missing the part about how today's food products contribute along with personal genetics.\n\nWillpower alone isn't the solution to all of today's problems...",
        "It is very simple -NO processed food!!! Cut it out, slowly or quickly, but cut it out.",
        "Rather than eating all that fat making prefab food.  Just buy the basics in the super market.  If people don't know how to make their own sandwich and take it to work then they have a bigger problem than just being fat.",

        "Obesity as it exists in the United States is a disease. It is beginning to appear in other countries too. I believe it exists because of poor education leading to poor choices. Children are not taught that processed food, salty food, fatty food it just plain bad. The schools do not promote good nutrition. Indeed, in my rural southern state some children go to school unfed. It is despicable. Most adults we see in the stores and on the street are fat. The skeleton is just as big as it needs to be, it does not grow as you grow. Please eradicate this disease and let's help out citizens. The government must act to protect the citizenry from itself.",
        "Why does this perfectly reasonable op-ed bring out such unbelievable anger? It's so weird. The author lays out a logical point about how food has drastically changed, has a great analogy about the rats, talks about the history of regarding obesity as a sin and therefore shameful, and people still come back with \"well, don't eat so much.\" Such strange, ironic responses.",
        "Been battling weight my entire life, as have some of my family members. The lack of discussion in this article about the emotional effects of being overweight and of battling the physiological pull to eat more (even if it's healthy food) can't be ignored. And then all I can think of is how \"Phen-phen\" popped up in the late 80s/early 90s (?) and the people I knew who took it dropped a ton of weight too quickly and gained it all back plus more. As with Ozempic and the like, I'm seeing people who didn't have that much to lose (<40 lbs) who have dropped weight far too quickly, who don't look healthy even if they're thin now, and who binge eat or drink every weekend because they miss those items. I've worked hard (and it is mental and physical work) over the last decade to drop 60lbs and keep it off--and I'm still not thin. Some weeks it's hard not to slip into old ways (multiple drinks with various social groups, for instance, or eating out to celebrate occasions) but I feel it on Monday and have to get right back to my newly established ways or suddenly I will gain 5 and then 10 pounds in a blink.\nThere's always going to be another drug being pushed. Let's leave the current crop to those who need it to control diabetes, not to those who just want to wear a smaller pair of pants.",
        "I think in the first paragraph itself is what may exasperate people the most: focusing on image. People will be irritated that insurance costs or drug prices may go up for vanity reasons... both T2D's and non-T2D's alike. T2D's maybe even more so if their prescription is unavailable and backordered. \n\nSo the author is claiming he lost 42 lbs in a year. However, he does not mention if he received any benefit from the medication regarding his metabolic or lipid panel numbers. He seems to focus on the unintended consequence of Oz instead of the true intent: improving glucose, reducing cardiovascular risks, and facilitating the pancreas and liver. \n\nIn addition, he does not mention if he has an improved body composition... for all we know he may have sarcopenia at 161 lbs. So if he still has a significant amount of visceral fat surrounding his organs, it will not matter how much he weighs or looks, he is still at risk for metabolic diseases. To me, losing weight is meaningless unless it is measured by seca-Medical Body Composition Analysis, Bod Pod, or Dexa. I feel at least one of those machines should be in endo offices and weight management clinics instead of the standard scale. The goal and conversation really should be centered around metabolic and lipid numbers in range, in tandem with improved body composition.",
        "If inflation makes food so expensive, it\u2019s a good thing right? Food has always been too expensive in excess. Eat what you can afford.",
        "A lot of hand wringing, wailing, and gnashing of teeth in this article: Science, none. Suddenly many folks can lose weight easily, and that upsets the naysayers. Reality is weight loss from simple, diet curbing drugs has been around for decades; mostly in the form of amphetamines.\n Thanks to politicians, amphetamines became controlled drugs and hard to get prescriptions from a doctor. Ironically, amphetamines have made a resurgence as ADD and ADHD medications for mostly young people, and now seeping into the general population. They also curb appetites. \n\nAnd there is a third front on this war on weight: Diabetic medications. Many of the diabetic medications work really well in curbing appetites, about as well as the other prescribed meds. So, suddenly, a lot of human fat is being shed. A leaner reality is threatening our portly future. \n\nWhile demand for big, American meals will likely become endangered, demand for new clothing will surge. Eventually science will elucidate the overall health impacts from experimenting with significant weight loss. Until that time arrives, expect more diatribes about taking the easier way out in the pursuit of thin physiques.",
        "For people who need to lose weight for health reasons, the only questions about these drugs should concern side effects.  Concern about losing weight the \"right\" way belongs in the 17th century with the Salem witch trials and other examples of Puritan moralizing.",
        "This is at least the start of a dialog even though I find the article a bit lacking.\nAs many others have observed, we have a for-profit health system that makes more money off of those with health problems. In a neat parallel, the food industry churns out lethal junk food. Meanwhile our bureaucracy turns a blind eye, or even worse abets the situation with lax rules on school lunches.\nAs a parent of a tween and a teen, I spend a huge chunk of time on grocery shopping and cooking. I am fortunate to have access and funds for healthy food, and to have space for a family garden. None of that is easy! \nWhile we\u2019re waiting for a better systemic solution, there are pockets of hope. In Detroit we have an organization promoting family and community gardens, it\u2019s amazing and I\u2019m sure is changing lives.",
        "I am deeply sympathetic to the author. However, in regards to the rat experiment: rats are not people. People can have food addiction, but not everyone does Do you think if you put a cheesecake in front of Ghandi in the midst of a hunger strike, he'd be compelled to eat it? Rats have no thoughts about \"this is a bad idea\" or \"maybe I should eat this if I'm starving.\" To say that we have no free will about anything is misleading, even if I understand how hard it is for many people not to overeat,or exercise.",
        "I feel sorry for this author and for all Americans who struggle with their weight. \n\nThe sad fact is, there are powerful capitalist forces aimed at each of us. Their only compunction is to make ever increasing profits. The well being of the \"consumer\" is not a consideration.\n\nBig Pharma, the for-profit Health Care industry, the Medical Insurance industry, Corporate Agriculture, the Fast Food and Processed Food industries \u2014 they all view us merely as sources of money to be manipulated, made ill, put on medication, and kept addicted. The ever increasing profits must be kept going at all costs. \n\nAnd the politicians who are supposed to protect us, to maintain the common good, are instead taking campaign contributions from the very industries that are preying on us.\n\nWe are like sheep being sheared relentlessly, until we bleed financially, until we get sick, until we die.\n\nOzempic is not a solution for obesity. It probably isn't even safe. The rebound weight gain after going off of it is alarming. It's just one more \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" fake solution, presented by the same industries that made you sick and obese in the first place. After poisoning you, they now present a dubious \"cure.\" For a massive profit, of course.",
        "One the problems is not what we but how we eat.  We eat so fast that our bodies can't tell us when we are full.  \n\nWe pile everything on one plate and shovel it in as fast as we can. If we ate slower, having 3 courses with a pause between we would get the same feeling of being  full on less food.\n\nI lived in Europe for 4 years , a quick lunch was an hour. We eat well bit Noth my wife and I lost weight. On getting back to the states and having 30 minutes for lunch we both gained back more weight that we had lost.",
        "I left the US 30 years ago and have seen things there get worse every year. Compared to my American family and friends, I buy fresh and cook healthy. I have better food choices here in Europe at normal prices. But it\u2019s because we vote for this life. We vote for regulation that limits supersize Walmarts to smaller, distant spaces and protects local stores offering fresh, homemade goods. We vote to tax UPF and junk food, and to enforce strict labeling, and to ban bad chemicals and limit GMO\u2019s. We vote for normal working hours that allow us to be home in time to make dinner for our family- and teach our kids to cook in the process. We vote to keep neighborhoods safe for walking almost everywhere, allowing us to get 7-10\u2019000 steps per day. We vote for universal healthcare so that governments regulate pharma companies instead of the other way around\u2026 allowing our doctors to prescribe rest, and exercise, and massage and PT instead of yet more chemicals and drugs that our bodies do not enjoy. Americans have let themselves be duped into thinking that big corporate offered them paradise at low prices. Walking that back will be almost Impossible.",

Nothing worked. Now I'm still eating that way but am active and pain free! A miracle!",
        "A drug that prompts eating less but doesn't actually redirect to healthier food seems unlikely to be as good as choosing to avoid the bad aisles in the supermarket and just going back to eating real foods. Just stop entering the chip/crisp aisle, the bakery, the candy aisle, the soda aisle. If the food industry forces us to have more will power than our grandparents needed, then the answer is surely to work on our will power. Declaring ourselves \"done with the shaming\" for behavior we know unhealthy isn't brave, it's defeatist.  What happens when bodies adjust to the drugs and their effect becomes muted? If our food choices haven't improved, we'll be back to bloating ourselves and dependent on the drugs merely to prevent our returning obesity from becoming morbid.",
        "People are not ignorant in respect to knowing what food is good or bad for them.

        "In Nov. 2019, I was 58 and had been fat since I was 26 or 27, the result of misdiagnosed and untreated PCOS and, as I learned in my 40s, the result of eating a lot of processed foods. I had been lucky -- normal blood pressure and A1C always -- and decided it was time to stop counting on luck.\n\nI started eating veg, beans, tofu, nut butters, steel-cut oats, brown rice, some quinoa, some millet, a little fruit, a little dairy, and some dark chocolate (a daily treat). Almost zero lab chemicals (save the occasional fake-chicken patty) and on average 10-15g of sugar daily. With the exception of the dark chocolate, I didn't weigh or measure anything; I didn't count calories. I ate when I was hungry and stopped eating when I was full.\n\nMy goal was better health, not explicitly weight loss, but I did slowly lose weight (36 lb) and have kept it off. I know enough about obesity to know that this won't work for everyone -- some people have genetic issues; and, the source of the calories is as important as the quantity -- and I am absolutely not scolding or shaming anyone for what they eat. \n\nI *am* imploring everyone (even people at a so-called healthy weight) to think about food as fuel and to choose the fuel that our bodies were designed to process.\n\nPS: My food budget was $4.50/day before COVID. I rely on frozen veg, which are much cheaper. Yes, the enviro impact of the plastic bags stinks; I'm trying to do something about that.",

        "I think, in the short term anyway, there is also a classist element to weight-loss drugs like Olympic.  Until we also get the health insurance industry on board, then it may be only the privileged who get access to the drugs in a way that doesn\u2019t break the bank.   Previous NYT coverage suggests these drugs must be taken forever to retain their effects. Forever is expensive. Gastric bypass is in a similar boat. I had gastric bypass about 8 years ago, but insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it. I cashed in my retirement account to afford it figuring that if I didn\u2019t have it I wouldn\u2019t be around to spend the 401k. I think my insurance today would cover it. I doubt they\u2019d cover Ozympic. Yet. Weight loss should ONLY be looked at as a medical treatment to a medical issue not a pathway to happiness. Society and industry should look at it like that too.",
        "What rubbish. The writer may have grown up on a diet of bacon, cheesecake, and snickers bars, but should not assume that applies to the rest of us. It may well be true that obesity involves satiety, but the problem is not going without eating long enough to feel hungry and, hence, never feeling full.

I am convinced that there are metabolic differences between men and women, in addition to genetic differences between people when it comes to weight and metabolism.  \nWe know that many of the chemicals in cosmetic and skin products have negative impacts on the endocrine system of people and women use those products a lot more than men.  We also know that scientific research that separated out effects between men and women is a fairly recent development.   My DNA test indicated I have a \"gene\" related to endurance exercise.  I also have hypothyroidism and all the women on one side of my family also have thyroid disorders and/or thyroid cancer.  I have struggled with being overweight since puberty.  The only times I was able to lose weight is when I exercised 2-3 hours per day (minimum) combined with dieting.  There were periods I was able to do this before becoming a mom, but I have not been able to engage in that level of exercise combined with dieting since I entered a phase of life where I am juggling work and being a mom to a young child.",

So, I think people are able to find unprocessed foods. My wife cooks, I grill, and I wash the dishes. \n\nI think we can find fresh foods, and avoid processed foods, if we take the time to prepare our own foods. It's rare that we eat out.

It's not some big mystery how to maintain a reasonable weight, the author explained it at the beginning, cook more food at home and buy less processed food. I hate exercise and never in my life have I been above the healthy bmi range. Because many of my family members are morbidly obese and suffer greatly before dying before their time, I cut out snacking in between meals periodically when my weight starts to creep up until I go back down to the weight that feels best. Nothing extreme is required here.\n\nI agree that we shouldn't mock or vilify overweight people, and those who have eating disorders and/or traumas that prevent them from controlling their behavior should get all the medical help they need, but most people can get this in check by just learning some simple kitchen skills.

        "The people I have known who face being overweight each have different factors causing that difficulty. What has helped those who have been successful in moderating their weight is also different for each of them. I have read many comments on this and other weight loss articles. Some of the commenters\u2019 suggestions might be helpful for some people. Some of the suggestions, such as adding whole grains to one\u2019s diet, would actually cause weight gain for me. I have to avoid carbs, simple or complex, if I want to maintain a lower weight. But, maybe adding complex carbs would help someone. Exercise really helps me with weight maintenance, but not with weight loss. Others I know simply add more exercise and weight starts to fall off. Exercise is, of course, important for overall well-being, so I exercise regularly. One lady I know lost hundreds of pounds by eating all her food at one meal and walking one hour per day. This was against the usual advice and I do not know if she maintained this loss. I have not met anyone for whom being shamed was helpful, but there might be some people for whom it worked. It did not work for me when my family of origin tried it on me. In any event, we are all different and I have no answers for anyone else. I know losing 10 pounds is a significantly different task than losing 100 pounds. I am happy for everyone who has found what works best for them with weight loss and maintenance.",

You could spend a fraction of the cost of those drugs just by eating better. It really isn't that hard today.

The programmer walks maybe a few hundred feet a day, while the ski patroller is out doing miles of vert. Beyond that, portion sizes are insane.

Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that signals the brain when the stomach is empty and it's time to eat. Ghrelin levels increase between mealtimes and decrease when the stomach is full. Ghrelin also promotes fat storage and stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone.\n7. Too bright lights at home increases stress, sleep deprivation and causing brain to produce more cortisol. And, alters the circadian rhythm. Night shift persons are hungry, snack more and gain more weight.\n\n8. Lack of exercise. \n9. Cheap processed  fatty, salty and sugary foods and beverages available effortlessly.\n\nGoal : Eat less, walk more, exercise more, sleep more. Eat healthy and better. Play and sweat more.

Nuclear waste transported across all over the US. \n2. Staying indoors in air conditioned closed spaces at home and work. Air conditioning confusing the hypothalamic pituitary axis and satiety centers to produce less TRH and TSH and causing an imbalance. Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 being the thermostats for the mitochondrial energy production. Low T3 and T4 cause the body to burn less fuel and hence gain weight. Leptin and Ghrelin imbalance leading to weight gain.\n3. Synthetic carpets with mites, pollen outdoors especially grass pollen causing allergies and blocked nasal passages causing obstructive sleep apnea. A vicious cycle of weight gain  sets in and a fatty tongue and narrowed respiratory passage causing more obstructive sleep apnea. Disturbed sleep and anoxia causing more confusion to the hypothalamic pituitary axis.\n4. Microwaves being used to reheat frozen foods.

That would mean that this is literally an epidemic.\n\nI recently was invited to a wedding at the nearby Mennonite Church.  A couple of notes.  There were maybe two people out of nearly 200 adults who could be considered morbidly obese.  Obesity is not common in this crowd.  I also observed that the school age and pre-school children sat quietly with their parents for the entire 90 min service--no games on phones or tablets to occupy them.  After they had eaten their dinners, they all went outside to play ball and other games.  This was very different from a service in a Catholic Church.  I know that all of the households cook with fresh ingredients and that they do not play video games and the like.

This seems extreme, and yet is quickly becoming as normalized as ordinary folks altering their faces in order to more closely resemble a filtered, airbrushed, digitally enhanced version of themselves. I also have questions about whether or not this is useful in the long-term; my understanding is that enduring change is the result of a deep behavior and habit modification. While I am aware that obesity is not in all cases the result of behaviors or habits, in some cases it is, and the wide net being cast by Ozempic and similar drugs must be catching people for whom it is not a matter of genetics but a matter of learned behavior.

        "Weight-loss drugs come with a stigma because they possess moral hazard. If you give someone a drug that cures unhealthy eating habits, we're trusting the medicine works as intended. There's a temptation to offset unhealthy eating habits instead of curing them. That behavior is typically contingent on the patient, not the medical professional.\n\nObesity gets the worst social treatment because obesity is so outwardly visible. We don't stigmatize cholesterol medicine in nearly the same way. However, we do mentally criticize people with bad cholesterol. If they ate better food, they wouldn't have bad cholesterol. It's a culturally accepted narrative with some scientific confirmation.\n\nThe problem is compounded by medical alternatives such as exercise. If you truly believe satiety is the root cause, it becomes a question of self-discipline. Here we have another culturally accepted narrative with some scientific fact.\n\nExercise is cliche though. The average person simply doesn't understand the problem. Sit down to a family dinner. Wait for everyone to get there. Get up when everyone is done. It's a healthy family exercise on multiple levels. We can reenforce the routine by simply downsizing our dinner plates. In the 1960s, the average dinner plate was the size of our current lunch plate. We take only what we can reasonably fit on a plate. The simple act of getting up discourages seconds.\n\nTaken together, medical intervention garners less sympathy.",

I've been on Mounjaro since September 2022 to keep prediabetes from becoming full-blown, and I've maintained a 25-30 lb. weight loss while seeing my A1C and blood sugar remain at healthy levels. \n\nThe benefits of these drugs cannot be understated. Just as cancer has exploded due to environmental changes, so have our relationships and physiological responses to food shifted as the makeup of the foods we eat has changed. I've never had a \"normal\" relationship with food, particularly sugar. Now, I can eat half of anything on my plate, enjoy one or two cookies without craving a half dozen more, and forget about food between meals. It's as if a switch has been turned off (or on, depending on how you look at it) in my brain.\n\nSome people avoid the difficult obsession with food that others experience, and some people get through life without cancer cells taking over their bodies. Medication that works is an opportunity, not a problem.",
        "What I find missing in the articles about weight loss drugs is changing the habits that involve fitness and diet change in conjunction with the drugs. These drugs are absolutely critical for those who need help getting to a healthier place, and there are those who exercise regularly who still don't shed weight as others do, however there are many who reject any cardio or won't work out at all to support any sort of healthy lifestyle. This includes walking and understanding some ability to work out, afford classes, a gym, or trainer is a privilege. But I come from a family where everyone is overweight and I am not, but I am not because I work incredibly hard at it. People see thin bodies and assume we were just given this healthy weight...no, I intentionally focus on my food intake and exercise to achieve this. I can put on weight easily and quickly. \n\nSo, while these drugs are absolutely necessary and offer hope to so many, I would like to see them as part of a lifestyle conversation and the ending of the assumption that thin people are just thing because they are thin. We aren't villains, and while some may be blessed with great genetics, there are a lot of us who are putting in a hell of a lot of effort into our overall health and habits.",
        "I'm glad the author has had success using Ozempic. But the narrative of  gluttonous, undeserving fat person that he wishes to replace with this newer enlightened Ozempic user is flawed. Of course we must stop shaming the obese. But he seems happy to blame the food industry alone for the rise in obesity. The food industry merely replied to demand. For at least 50 years, the medical establishment have vigorously & relentlessly insisted that the only way to avoid death via cardiovascular disease was to eat a diet high in carbohydrates, drastically low in fat and nevermind the sugar, it won't do you any harm. Eggs were the new enemy and meat should be consumed very sparingly. And exercise is the new religion. So consumers pushed for low fat everything from meat to dairy to cookies and potato chips & a gym opened on every corner. The AHA told us to eat anything we wanted so long as it was low fat. The food industry responded with a dazzling array of low-fat everything, even breeding lower fat animals to develop low-fat pork, turkey and chicken. Even after very quietly reversing their erroneous dictate about saturated fat, most people (and doctors) are so deeply indoctrinated with the low fat dogma that many people cannot bring themselves to eat the kind of diet the author's father enjoyed growing up. There's a great deal wrong with our food system, but its origins are in the flawed, unscientific approach to nutrition and health brought to you by your doctor.",
        "The author makes solid points. \n\nHowever, satiety issues are not the sole cause of obesity. Metabolism and genetics play important role that are difficult to treat by dietary changes alone. \n\nOur diets have been manipulated over several generations by a food industry focused on profits \u2014a purely capitalist strategy via the exploitation of our love of sugar and the low cost of mass produced and processed food. Fast food (and high processed foods)  role in obesity is analogous to the tobacco industry\u2019s denial of lung cancer. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for obesity is and has always been making healthy food affordable, changing behaviors (particularly for parents feeding their kids), regular exercise, and de stigmatizing the overweight image (as a healthy weight is not always a perfect BMI ). It will take generations.",

One little condescending talk and they could eliminate smoking, opioid addiction, serial adultery, alcoholism obesity, and all the little disturbances of man. Don't soothe your loneliness or your weariness or your existential angst or your shame or your fear or your awarenss of your mortality this way. Be like me.

        "It really isn't about how people look, and or morality. It is however, the fact that now over 60% of all Americans including children are overweight and obese.  This will not only shorten their lives, but bring them early onset of high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, more cancer, etc.  Having had a family over 5 generations who has had 18 doctors in it, I know of the toll that this has taken on the medical community. There aren't now enough medical professionals to manage all of these chronic conditions, and the costs are exorbitant as well.  My husband's father died at 40 of a sudden heart issue.  This was back in 1954 before there were MRIs of the heart, stents, bypass, drugs, etc.  The family also had a genetic component for high cholesterol.  All of his siblings have had heart procedures, and or on drugs.  Plus, the culture they grew up in was one of high fat, high salt, and high sugar food.  It was a Mennonite one.  I literally saw the beginning of the obesity epidemic starting for our country, after females entered the work force full time, and never spent the time cooking like they did previously and resorted to feeding their families a lot of meat pizzas, and Pepsi, and Coca Cola, which wasn't diet, as this goes back 52 years ago.   No, caring isn't indulging all of the above, rather if we had to pay for our premiums like they do in Switzerland, where previous smokers still pay more each month, we would change our habits, and give up using food for a pacifier.",
        "Accepting the notion that \"you have to tolerate hunger or engage in extreme forms of exercise\" in order to lose weight and/or maintain a healthy weight is as much a part of the problem as believing obesity is a sin. Losing weight does not have to mean tolerating hunger or engaging in extreme exercise. I lost 50 pounds after having a heart attack and bypass surgery. My health scare was a powerful motivation for me. But I quickly found out that it's not hard to make meals from scratch, to use healthy ingredients, to stay out of the cookie/chips/candy aisles at the grocery store. I also found that, contrary to what I had assumed, it was not a chore to go to a gym and that working out can actually be fun. People are convinced that losing weight can only be an unpleasant experience. It's not. That idea has to be turned around.",

Not all weight problems will be solved with a new medication or harsh exercise programs.\nIt seems that obesity is seen as a failure of willpower: if you just had the willpower to resist eating those chips, ... then you wouldn't be fat... This makes it a very personal judgement of an individual.\nWe need to view obesity as a medical problem that needs to be understood and then solved.\nSome people gain weight due to medications prescribed by their PCP. Others gain weight when they suffer injuries that restrict their activity. Genetics also appears to play a role.\nBut, the typical medical advice is: eat less, move more.\nIt is simplistic, almost like telling someone: don't get cancer.",

        "While I agree with the theme of this article--yes processed foods and sedentary lifestyles are the source of obesity in this nation.  However, on a personal note, in high school and college I was termed in a doctors office as obese (230 lbs). Out of college, this was 50 years ago, my wife and I attended a weight watchers meeting, and, adopted their dietary regime. In those lecture/weigh ins, I remember a comment made by a representative: \"Weight watchers is not a diet program, it is a way of life.\" Granted the early weight watchers program was let us say, a bit, draconian for someone brought up on bagels and pasta meals (especially that awful high cream), but, I lost 65 pounds. and over the years, my wife and I were able to modify the regime---essentially, a lot of fish, chicken, salads, vegetables, fruit--and, did, get into attending gym regularly---Yes, we do cheat---my wife still has a sweet tooth, and, bread/cold cuts/bacon/chips are my weakness, but, maybe on Saturday---but, even these cheats just don't agree well with us anymore---and, the benefit of being able to move well on a tennis court and the gym far surpass that Friday pizza.",
        "I question the explanation is that modern American diet delays satiety. Food has become more abundant and physical activity associated with daily life has diminished. Except in big cities, people don\u2019t walk anywhere. If you want to do your 10,000 steps or more, you need to go to the gym.\nEven in medical setting eating is unhealthy. When I was doing my training in cardiology, the common food during call duty was pizza. In the national conferences the stands of pharmaceutical companies offer chocolate chip cookies. Progressively, we adapted. There are now hospital beds that can accommodate individuals who weigh 500 pounds or more. Wheelchairs became double wide. Clothing sizes reach 3 and 5 XXL. All that happened in less than a hundred years, so the explanation that it is biologically determined is incorrect as our genes do not change that fast. It is basically behavior based. We could gain significant information if a major chain like Walmart released what is selling in their groceries, but I doubt it will ever happen.",

I\u2019m blessed to live in an area with almost too many good grocery stores - including Trader Joe\u2019s where I can get high quality produce for a reasonable price tag. My best friend lives in an area of Florida where she is surrounded by farms growing produce - and none of it goes into their community. It all gets shipped away and their only produce section is at Walmart. For the people living in her community, can I blame them for taking ozempic? No. Not really. They don\u2019t have many choices. They don\u2019t have a nice, convenient gym. They don\u2019t have access to quick, yummy, healthy food.

        "A lovely analysis.  Utterly devoid of endocrinology - other than the casual mention of thyroid cancer.   It does not substitute for scientific knowledge. The 'Etiology of Insulin Resistance' (2006) is more informative: 'Novel investigational techniques based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have allowed real-time insight into the molecular defects in patients with type 2 diabetes, revealing that insulin resistance is a product of decreased insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis, which can mostly be attributed to decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Glut 4) activity. This defect appears to be a result of intracellular lipid-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)\u20131 tyrosine phosphorylation resulting in reduced IRS-1\u2013associated phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase activity. The hypothesis that insulin resistance is a result of accumulation of intracellular lipid metabolites (e.g., fatty acyl CoAs, diacylglycerol) in skeletal muscle and hepatocytes is supported by observations in patients and mouse models of lipodystrophy. Furthermore, the increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity observed in patients with type 2 diabetes following weight loss is also accompanied by a significant reduction in intrahepatic fat without any changes in circulating adipocytokines (interleukin-6, resistin, leptin).  <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995525\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995525</a>/  'These drugs' affect insulin resistance.

Unfortunately, my sugar continued to rise. I started on the now very old fashion, but still effective metformin. Please ask your doctor about it. With the help of a nutritionist and further modifications to my diet I started to lose weight and lower my glucose. I learned a couple of things. Vegan and vegetarian food can be heavy with carbs which may have added to my glucose but simultaneously lowered my cholesterol and blood pressure. I cut out added sugar completely, it is addictive. The first week or so was difficult. It did get better and now can walk by it. I also eliminated all bread and potatoes and prefer brown rice but only a little. I also keep track of calories and carbs using a simple app. I also increased measurable daily exercise which means time at the gym. Miracle, my sugar is going down I hope to normal levels and I lost weight. No processed food, if it\u2019s not a real vegetable or legume, I avoid it. I stopped eating beef or pork and now only some chicken or fish. Pilates etc helped with strength. Unfortunately, I will be living this way for life. I don\u2019t have cheat days.

They also, much of the time, don't have the luxury of a gym membership or the time to run, or do some other form of exercise. So, why are middle and upper middle class people also obese? Because they have body dysmorphia, eat and/or drink too much, and then want everything to \"go away\" fast. I have struggled with my weight my entire life.

There are so many obese people now that it seems okay to use overweight models, advertise to the obese, and create a DEI category to \"protect\" them.

And Ozempic does work.  Unfortunately, once started you must take it for life or the weight will just come back, just like any other temporary diet change.  The only proper method of permanent weight loss is changing your diet and exercising.  To eat a proper diet, however, requires you to do a lot of your own food preparation, since commercially processed foods are mostly not healthy.  And most of us are too lazy to exercise regularly.  So, something like Ozempic for life may be the only permanent solution for most.  Hopefully, we won't discover years from now any bad side effects.  Hopefully.",

I eventually discovered low-carbohydrate dieting, and cutting back severely on carbohydrates helped me lose 30 pounds. When my body began to adjust to this regimen and I again put on weight, my doctor added metformin. The combination of these two therapies kept my weight within normal body mass limits. But a cousin using these same techniques was still obese, too overweight to qualify for a knee replacement that was sorely needed. Adding Mounjaro is helping get her weight to levels where she'll hopefully qualify for a knee replacement. We all must do what we can to eat healthy foods and keep a normal body weight.",
        "When we're talking about the relationship between diet, lifestyle and obesity, (for adults of sound mind), we can't pretend that personal responsibility on the choices isn't at the heart of the matter. Yes, there is well advertised junk food now, but also many resources than ever for better diet and exercise. If we can walk and chew gum at the same time we can acknowledge this while being compassionate and nonjudgmental towards those struggling with this issue. Just as I think of cigarette addicts: I don't pretend that it's not unhealthy nor that smokers can blame the whole problem on tobacco firms. Nor do I shame them or fail to understand how hard that lifestyle change will be to beat. These weight loss drugs are concerning for their side effects, and they also don't capture all the benefits people would gain from simply eating healthier and exercising more, like the significant mental health benefit from better diet and physical activity and healthier skin. That's not all available in a pill, and the pills already seem to have seriously concerning side effects before we even know about their long term effects. It also seems unlikely that someone who makes  bad choices on their diet and lifestyle health and only makes the change of taking one or more of these drugs is really going to be healthier in the end - even assuming no unintended side effects from the drugs. So why is the diet-lifestyle-change approach seen as better? Those are a few good reasons why.",
        "Our bodies evolved when food was mostly low density in calories and the energy expended to get it was considerable. When people found food with dense calories they gorged to gain fat to help them avoid starvation. Those kinds of foods are plentiful but the urge to overeat them remains. People must learn how to eat to avoid gaining weight they do not need. Once those kinds of habits are established, they can keep their weight healthy without extraordinary efforts.",

I don\u2019t have an answer, but to believe that millions of us will begin to eat fresh harvested and fresh cooked food is a fantasy, just like it is not going to happen that the food industry will be significantly reigned in.  Perhaps we ought to focus research and treatment dollars on exactly how does our food supply do what it does to us and how exactly can an person be helped to break what appears to be a cycle of addiction.

He's saying that even if he was happy to have lost weight on Ozempic, he's reluctant to promote drugs to others if what might be better for everyone is that we return to a more whole-foods diet. \n\nI say, why not both? There just needs to be a clear messenger on the diet side promoting a return to more whole foods, including animal source foods along with produce, along with drugs if one feels weight loss is otherwise impossible. A recent NYT article had many comments about how it's hard to find time to cook whole foods. But what is the whole \"girl dinner\" trend about if not promoting minimal cooking while eating whole healthy foods? While I'm not a fan of trends, this one seems like a sensible one for both \"girls\" (women) and men.",

My statement has always been met with consternation, anger, flat-out denial, and accusations of being a \"conspiracy theorist.\" (This comment section is full of the \"personal responsibility\" argument.)

        "I appreciate your story and agree with your assessment of the food industry (the rat study is fascinating). I also agree that we remain oddly fixated on obesity as a moral issue. As a scientist, though, my hesitancy about ozempic is twofold: \n\n1. As you mentioned, I worry that the short term weight loss may come at the cost of long term problems with loss of lean muscle mass, which is especially important in aging. Muscle is crucial for metabolism, making it likely that people who stop using ozempic will face even greater challenges than they had to start. Lean muscle mass is deeply connected to blood sugar regulation and even cognitive health. Please do read up on this.\n\n2. My second fear is that drugs like ozempic enable our food industry (which I fault for the obesity epidemic) to continue to pursue practices that devastate us with disease, now that there is the appearance of a quick solution (which as I've said, I worry is not actually a solution). My hope is that we can find relief for people while still challenging the systems that harm them.\n\nThat said, my best wished to you. Thank you so much for sharing your story and thoughtfully reflecting on this important issue. All of us can reflect on our inner critic, and the way we punish ourselves or others for problems that are more complex than just ourselves.",

Instead the notion being asserted is that society must dissuade people from self motivated behaviors in favor of society determining how everyone should live to be well and socially well adjusted. If one uses Ozempic to cure obesity, one must take it for life, and that is bad. The organism remains incapable of affecting its own well being.",
        "It sounds like a cop-out to blame processed foods and the companies who create them for obesity.  Ultimately, it's the choice of the consumer on what to eat and drink--or not--regardless of cravings. \n\nCertainly, whole-grain rice isn't inherently as tasty as potato chips. But the latter doesn't sate the appetite better than the former: rather, it sets you up for more junk food cravings. \n\nAnd no one is too busy to measure some boullion and rice (or better yet, quinoa, which has more protein) into a pot and just let it cook. Similarly, an apple isn't necessarily as tasty as apple pie, but the minimal effort of sprinkling slices of apple (particularly a sweet variety, like Cosmic Crisp) with cinnamon is a tasty and much healthier choice. And don't forget all the empty calories in beverages. (No really one needs to drink anything but water--and it's affordable.) It's never too late to start, and it's unlikely that the current medications will be a long-term solution for obesity without diet modifications.\n\nTo top it off, your bodily feels better when you make healthier food choices and relegate procesed foods/beverages to \"just on occasion.\"",

I feel fine but I just don't think about food anymore. The food noise is just gone. I have to remind myself to eat so I don't start feeling sick.

        "One thing that makes so many of us so susceptible to the food industry's highly-processed addictive products is what conservative ideologues would call the decline of the \"traditional family.\" \n\nIn the past, most women were full-time homemakers. They shopped for fresh ingredients and had the time to cook delicious food from scratch, as their own mothers taught them in preparation for their ordained role in their future husband's home. Social change has given women many options beyond a husband's domestic helpmate, though in practice too many women still manage the homemaking burden in addition to full-time jobs. Conservative economic policies have made two incomes necessary to maintain a standard of living for which one breadwinner would formerly have sufficed. And the majority of Americans no longer live in \"traditional families.\" \n\nOne consequence of this change is that many if not most of us do not have the time, skill, or inclination to buy fresh ingredients and use them to cook healthy meals from scratch. And, of course, the food industry (and its shareholders) are more than happy to fill the gap with highly-processed (and highly profitable) factory-prepared foods.\n\nI am not suggesting a return to \"tradition,\" as Christianist conservatives would wish. Rather, if we can't create conditions that allow us to cook healthy meals from scratch, the food industry needs to be regulated so they'll do that for us. The savings in health care costs should be significant.",

I'd wake in the night, ravenous - something I've never experienced. And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't drop the weight. After age sixty, it becomes extremely difficult. But I tried even harder, with mainly veggies, fruit and a bit of fish or chicken now and then. Tiny portions. I finally dropped the weight. If this had been a lifetime struggle, I'd have been miserable and would be the first person in line for Ozempic.\n\nThat said, we've known for a very long time how unhealthy and dangerous our food culture is. For some reason, people believe healthy eating is time consuming and expensive. It is neither. It just isn't nearly as fun as fast food, ice cream and cookies.

If you don\u2019t know how to cook, it isn\u2019t rocket science. It is a matter of priority setting. I disagree with people playing the victim to Big Food and obesity. I can only give that free pass to people below the poverty line living in food deserts with no transportation. The vast majority of obese and overweight Americans are happily not in that situation. They just prioritize other things (career, TV, social media scrolling, whatever) over their health. And then blame Big Food for all their ills.

If people don't have time to cook a healthy meal or the money to buy one, I'd guess that they will overeat if it's fast food.  \n\nThe problem may not be eating meat or whatever we decide the offending food is.

My mother refused to keep soda in the house.  She wouldn't keep lots of sweets either.  I got my dose of all of that when I was in camp or in college.  After I graduated from college I stopped with the soda and other things too.  \n\nI tend to eat home made fruit salad for a snack.  I prefer water with some lime juice or mint in it.  I like to make my own cookies and cakes.  The problem is that our lives don't leave us much room to cook or to exercise.  \n\nI wonder too, how much our weight issues are due to what our fruits, vegetables, and meats are treated with before they ever reach the point of being food.",

        "Having lived in the US for many years and equally many in India, I can say that the American way of life promotes obesity in ways one is unaware of while living it. (Been there, done that).\nIts not just packaged food, but that a lot of people who live in houses with great kitchens stuffed with appliances, just don't home-cook much. Everyone at home is so busy, busy, busy with their lives outside the home that they neglect family health inside the home. Cooking fresh food everyday can be monotonous, unappealing and unsustainable especially after a rough day in the (home)office and a miserable commute. And if you have disposable income, you just take out. Just watch the Netflix serials: everybody is gorging on take-outs and pizza. (This shade of Americana is catching on everywhere else as well, including India). \nAnd then there's drive-drive-drive everywhere and for everything. So you have to \"make time\" to move. And the weather isn't exactly inviting a lot of the time. And we haven't even got started with the bottom 50% who can't afford anything but cheap junk food.\nThink of the discipline to fight that, everyday. If you do it, I tip my hat to you.",

The concept of getting fed at a drive through window without even leaving your car would have been something for an SF parody. Even in the drive in restaurants you sat in the car and ate without driving; they idea of eating while on the road was as alien as having a dozen cup holders built into the car.\nA big department store might have a lunch counter or even a restaurant built in; not a food court with twenty different kiosks. Coffee was something you bought at a diner or coffee shop, not a requirement which had to be available at multiple outlets in every block, and coffee shops used to sell mostly coffee with a few small food items, rather than entire meals.

Not only does diabetes increase your risk of heart attack and stroke, which I had, it can make eating unpleasant. When you have diabetes, eating can make you feel sick. For me, food became an enemy.\n\nBy coincidence, I happened to have one of my biannual doctor visits this morning. He told my A1C was 6.4.  A1C is part of a blood test that gives your average blood sugar level over the previous 3 months. The target range is 4.5 - 6.5. For the 2nd consecutive test in a year, my blood sugar level was in the target range. That had never happened even once, before I started taking the Ozempic shots a year and a half ago. \n\nObesity is not just a weight crisis. It's a health crisis. And should be treated as such.

Most of those diseases have their roots in lifestyle - how we eat, move, sleep, connect, manage stress, find/make meaning (plus smoking/booze). Yes, genetics plays a role- but in most cases it mainly determines our proximity to the various \"cliffs\" of chronic disease. Our lifestyles determine the rate and speed with which we approach or withdraw from those cliffs. \n\nI'm grateful for these remarkable new drugs. But I fear the long-term consequences if we don't help our patients make the simple (if not easy) lifestyle changes required to secure a healthier future. \n\nWe didn't drug our way into this problem.  We won't drug our way out of it.",
        "I have had to watch my weight all my life. The way to keep the weight down is is by not eating processed foods which are  unhealthy and make you eat more. These drugs don't seem to do anything for all the fat and sugar in processed foods. So your thin but still unhealthy.",
        "This is a very long winded way in saying that individuals make poor choices and have lack of self-control. Sure, there are cases where a person's hormones cause an individual to not process calories and retain fat but those are the outliers. If it weren't, we wouldn't have seen such a dramatic spike to obesity rates for the past 3 decades. While I agree processed foods lead to weight gains overtime, if consumed moderately, weight gain would be nominal if balanced with low calorie, nutrient rich foods. It's up to the individual to choose to eat healthy and reward that healthy behavior with the occasional indulgence in those processed, salty snacks. An anecdotal example, every week I bring supplies to make salads to work and supplement when hungry with apples and vegetables. My co-workers meanwhile order out nearly everyday; pizza, fast food, etc., while indulging on the many sweets that tend to visit the office. Not surprisingly, two are type 2 diabetic, while all of them are over-weight/obese. They also make the occasional comment making fun of my \"obsessive healthy eating\".

        "What about a natural inability to reach saiety?\n\nI went on my first diet in 7th grade, which was in 1969, when real food was still a thing. My eldest brother had been obese and lost a lot of weight between high school and college.  I struggled to keep the weight off by basically starving myself - at least what felt like starving.  I did liquid protein diets with no solid food, ate one meal a day, took amphetamines.  By the time I was in my late 20s, I had lost the battle because I was living with a man who believed in eating meals and could do so with impunity.  He thought I  should eat too; to enjoy varied and good food, sharing a meal, going out to restaurants.  He never made me feel bad about my weight gain and that's a good thing because I was miserable enough. \n\nPeople struggled with weight long before the ruination of the American diet.

        "Put aside the societal and emotional issues around obesity and diet for a moment, and consider the fact is these obesity drugs are destroying the health of a large segment of the population. If you have no desire to eat, you aren\u2019t consuming adequate nutrients. You aren\u2019t feeding your microbiome. Your body will suffer in the short term, and that will manifest in long-term problems like osteopenia, and gut and heart issues.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve take an obesity drug for a year, what then? Do you continue for another year? And another? If you have done nothing but suppress your appetite, for months or years, you have learned nothing about maintaining a healthy diet. You have not changed your behavior or your emotional relationship to food. You have traded food dependency for drug dependency. \n\nTake some advice from a woman with osteoporosis: take care of your body! Feed it nutritious food. Give it adequate calcium and vitamin d, probiotic and prebiotic foods. Manage your stress. Learn to accept and love the body you were given.

Maybe a lot of people just don\u2019t know how to cook and so they fear that making meals from scratch is fancy, expensive and time-consuming?

One side effect of our capitalist economic malfeasance is obesity. \nWe should not blame the victims.",
        "As usual, comments on and article about weight loss bring out the rigidly judgmental. Thus proving the article\u2019s thesis several times over. People, is it possible to be more obtuse? Amazing. \n\nSince I\u2019ve always been naturally thin and never dieted, and don\u2019t have any of these problems, it\u2019s always been obvious to me that different people have radically different experiences around food, eating and weight. I also concluded about twenty years ago that dieting was almost guaranteed to make you fat. \n\nPeople are different from each other. That is the lesson.",

        "One thing that has shocked me about moving from Europe to the U.S. is the hidden added sugar in so many foods. Buy ordinary bread, a pate, or some kind of sausage - all of them have needlessly added sugar in the U.S. - traditionally none of them have added sugar in Europe.",
        "The author writes:  \u201cOurs is a society full of people fighting against the forces in our food that are making us fatter. It is often painful to do this: You have to tolerate hunger or engage in extreme forms of exercise.\u201d\n\nThis is simply not true. And the author even knows this; he contrasts what his father grew up eating, fresh whole food cooked from scratch and eaten on the same day with what he grew up eating, reheated heavily processed food. And that\u2019s the reason he gained weight.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to eat the way his father did; he chooses not to do that, but doesn\u2019t say why. Instead, he blames a toxic food environment. But it is possible to make other choices, to avoid it.\n\nI go a step further, and eat whole plant foods, since there is ample evidence that animal products aren\u2019t healthy for us in the long run. But I buy fresh whole food (sometimes frozen, canned, or dried) \u2014 veggies and fruit, legumes and whole grains, and nuts, seeds, and mushrooms \u2014 and prepare food that I eat that day (though I also cook in batches, since I love left-overs!). And when I started eating this way, I lost weight, and now weigh about what I did in high school.\n\nThere are many, many health and other benefits to eating whole plant foods, but simply starting with dropping heavily processed foods and cooking meals from fresh whole food is an excellent start. And no drugs are necessary for most people.",
        "It seems to me that the obesity epidemic really took off in the 1980s. But there was plenty of processed food available starting well before that. TV dinners were widely available and highly popular in the 1950s. Plus, the portion sizes that are provided on prepared food labels were set by the Federal government back in the 1970s, based on what people actually ate, and they are remarkably small compared to what people eat today. So, I'm not sure the villain is processed food ruining our sense of satiety. Given the historical trend lines of various factors, it seems like obesity coincided more with the popularity of high-calorie fast foods, full of fat and sugar, which deranged our metabolisms in a way that persists even after we wean ourselves off of them, combined with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle that, crucially, begins in childhood these days.",

It also is omitting a key point of context here, in the majority of human history, the vast majority of the population never felt sated after eating a meal, but ate what they could. This was the normal reality up until after world war 2. The habit we have developed in the west, eating until you are full, is a modern cultural concept. In places like Japan, there are even cultural concepts about not eating until you are full. \n\nFurthermore, it also leads out that increasingly sedentary lifestyles prevent us from burning the calories the human body is used to, as it is built to walk several miles a day.\n\nThere is no \"primary reason\" why weight gain has become an epidemic, but rather it's a combination of many major factors, none having a provable \"bigger\" impact than others.",

        "As an American who moved to Mexico a few years ago and still travels back and forth regularly, I'm  walking proof of this food phenomena.  Most recently I spent two months in Dallas and gained 10 lbs PER MONTH doing pretty much exactly the same things I do daily in MX.  Came back down to MX and lost that same excess weight over about 90 days without adjusting my physical activity levels.\n\nA few key differences up there vs. down here.  \n\n1) Fast food.  It is available in MX, but on a typical day I do not walk or drive past a single fast food restaurant.  Yes, I could get McD's or Dom's on UberEats, and I actually do once in a while.  But generally they're out of sight & out of mind.\n\nSo in MX, I tend to eat at restaurants where food is made fresh.  It tends to be spicier and less sweet than similar food in US.  If there are fries on the side, you can count them.  Like 10 or 15.  Not a half pound of spuds!\n\nand -\n\n2) Fast food advertising:  In MX one rarely encounters TV except at sports bars.  So I'm virtually never being exposed to ads for BWW, Wendy's, Pizza Hut, and all of that.  Which is great, because personally I know that these do tend to trigger me.\n\nSide note:  Ads in the US seem to be about 50% fast food related, and 50% pharmaceuticals like GLP1s and meds for disorders related to G.I. issues and diabetes.  \n\nBut one wonders how in the world can all this \"Artificial treatments for artificial problems\" (or however the article sagely stated it) get undone?",

        "There's a very fine line between \"fat shaming\" and recognizing the effects of obesity on health and longevity. It isn't hyperbole to state flatly that obesity is deadly.\n\nBut I agree with the article about the food industry. It is wickedly powerful. In discussing obesity with my patients, I often share my own struggles: I'm tempted by fast food EVERY time I leave my house, I think all day about ice cream when I know it's in my freezer; I've gained and lost around 40lbs, now on my 4th swing. \n\nCurrently I'm in a \"success\" phase and near my ideal body weight. Feels, if I'm honest, just ok. Many of my happiest moments in life were when I allowed myself to eat whatever and WHENever I wanted. THOSE were the glory days. Skipping food and maintaining my weight does not bring the utopian life as advertised.\n\nI don't have an answer to the problem, but I agree this is bigger than our individual moral failings. I suppose we could outlaw McDonalds. And I'd probably be one of the marchers in the streets bemoaning the Nanny State (and internally thinking, \"you know it wouldn't hurt if those double quarter pounders weren't constantly at your fingertips\").\n\nLately my strategy has been to tell my patients that GLP-1's are a bridge to a healthier lifestyle.

A size 12 was a normal, trim, size. I sure don't recall size 0 in those days! Those were also the days before high fructose corn syrup largely replaced sugar in processed foods. Sugar was beginning to be seen as a villain, but artificial sweeteners were still largely restricted to things like saccharin or Sucaryl, added to coffee.  The highly processed convenience foods really started to flood the market after the 1960s - and were welcomed because they meant less time spent cooking. They were also designed to taste better than the home cooking they were meant to replace.\n\nIt's all well and good to say we should be eating more fresh foods, but not everyone has the time  or the cooking facilities. And there are people who truly hate to cook and will eat junk food to avoid having to fiddle with food preparation.  \n \nPerhaps manufacturers can start up new competitions for having the least ultra-processed foods.

I live alone and choose a mostly vegetarian diet for myself, and feel it is more important to avoid chemical additives than any other food group, and shop accordingly. It is much more expensive to buy a loaf of bread from the local bakery than packaged bread at the supermarket, but I do it to avoid chemicals. Local produce at a farmers market would be ideal, but is unaffordable even shopping for me alone, so supermarket produce it is. I seriously doubt I could afford to feed a family this way.

The frightening part about the culture of these drugs is that they cause both muscle and fat loss.  Muscle is the long term solution to fat because it burns the fat for energy.  That is why when you stop the drugs you gain back most of the fat.  Fundamentally you have decreased your ability to regulate weight by talking GLP1 drugs for weight loss.

If your doctors are making sure you are getting enough nutrients and food then maybe this drug is safe, but until we live in a society where doctors actually know nutrition and are basing their nutrition recommendations on individual patient needs, and can acknowledge that overweight people can having eating disorders like anorexia then I just think these drugs are too dangerous.\n\nI found out too late that I was a bad candidate for this drug as I already have a poor appetite. I didn't take it for weight loss reasons as I wasn't overweight at the time, but I could not eat the entire 8 months I was on it because I had zero appetite. I was only put on this because another drug I used to take for a hereditary condition would no longer be covered by insurance because its price increased over 500%.

        "There are a lot of factors at play here, but one important factor is a lack of clear information about what a healthy diet entails.  So many people focus on strictly limiting their calories, just to eventually go off the rails and binge on junk food when their body fights against the shortage.  And there are also so many diets with a focus on one macronutrient, such as the focus on eating mostly fat while on a keto diet, and myopic dietary patterns like this often have the same poor results as those focused on caloric restriction.\n\nWhat seems to work best in my own life is eating mostly unprocessed foods prepared at home and with reasonable proportions of the three macronutrients (fats, carbs, and proteins).  Ten years ago when I was eating a more traditional American diet with lots of processed foods, I couldn't make it longer than 2-3 hours without needing a snack.  Now, I can eat just three meals a day without the need for snacking most days, and my blood sugar levels usually feel very stable throughout the day.  I eat until I'm relatively full without worrying about counting calories, and I'm able to maintain a healthy weight.  \n\nI know I'm just one person and that every body is different, but I think we would do much better if we would get away from the extreme diets and calorie counting.

You aren't better, you don't have more willpower - you've just got satiety signals that WORK.",
        "Overly processed, unhealthy food and artificial flavors that fool you into eating more than you need are a big part of this problem. But another part is the American worship of convenience. It means fast food is everywhere, at all times, and any media you watch or hear is full of it, too. We are not biologically able to ignore so many signs of \u201cfood\u201d\u2014our distant ancestors who hunted and gathered would have evolved to react strongly to any food opportunity.\n\nWe need comprehensive public health reforms to roll back decades of poor eating caused by our love of convenience. And basic cooking and nutrition education for all our kids.",
        "Unpopular viewpoint warning here - \n\nmy family, friends and I joke (as in not funny) that we have some corporations colluding to make the population en masse \u201ca bit sick\u201d with their addictive processes thereby making money off our backs while others offer us \u201cremedies\u201d for the very ails the others cause. \n\nLikely a minority group we are in these thoughts and opinions, but we dare say this is corporate greed run amok.",
        "I really feel for those obese individuals who are desperate.\nHowever, I don't accept that adopting the role of a victim, trapped by the junk/cheap food culture, is helpful. This same culture has produced widespread writing, education, and a vast health and fitness industry for at least 50 years,- AND plenty of aversion to obesity. \nWhat a horrendous experimental environment in which to begin widespread use of these agents. Will any of us be surprised in a few years to learn that these agents speed up,- not suppress, tumor growth, dementia, Parkinson's?",
        "I wanted long term weight loss. I did it the traditional way. Counseling for the stress. Gym for exercise. Healthy eating. I lost 15% of body weight. Now doing more strength training. I came to learn there aren\u2019t any easy answers to weight loss, it takes time, patience and a lifestyle change.",
        "What is the moral basis for \"shaming\" someone who takes prescribed medicine that appears to have real health benefits? Does anyone contest that obesity is a condition that takes a toll on the body and can reduce life expectancy?\n\nThese GLP-1 drugs aren't purely aesthetic, the equivalent of cosmetic surgery (though there can be \"cosmetic\" benefits from losing weight) or anti-depressants like SSRIs, which also help people feel better about themselves and are also widely prescribed (or over-prescribed).\n\nDo we still shame people for seeking those commonplace treatments?\n\nThe danger here might be in treating this new class of \"wonder drugs\" as if it were a panacea, while ignoring or downplaying the serious risks you mention. But that would be the prescribers' fault more than the users'.",
        "Fascinating about the rats and the American diet. \n\nI know there are companies that just alter the flavor and smell (and sometimes, the look) of products to be more appealing. Even orange juice in the US is highly manipulated in terms of smell and flavor. \n\nIt's deeply disturbing. Everything here has sugar added. \n\nI went overseas for 9 days and ate a lot and wasn't really doing much activity due to the nature of the vacation. Yet, I lost 5 pounds that I can't lose here in the US.",
        "I\u2019m one of six children of German immigrant. We grew up eating my mother\u2019s cooking. She was trained as a cook in Germany. She cooked everything from scratch. We only had soda on our birthday or a holiday. Her motto was lots of green vegetables and smaller portions of carbs and protein. \n\nA neighbor asked her \u201chow come all your children got fat after they left home ?\u201d  Putting aside the rudeness of the question, the answer was we started eating American food.",
        "I would like to know if the author was able to change her eating habits and how she is doing off the ozempic?",
        "Perhaps. But giving yourself chemical injections of god-knows-what might not be the greatest idea either.",
        "I don't get it!   Instead of buying Ozempic, why don't just skip the frozen food and snack aisle at the supermarket???   What you don't have in your pantry won't make you fat, duh!",
        "It's more than just the kind of food. It's everything that goes with our lifestyles. I went from teaching five classes a week in a nearby building, not only walking from my office, but moving about the classroom as I taught, to teaching completely online. I could work really hard for hours a day never getting up except to eat or go the bathroom. Though it winded me, I made myself take the stairs to my second-floor office. I was a model employee as I put on 40 pounds. Where I live, I could have walked to work, but there are no sidewalks. Even city people who use the bus have to walk to the bus stop. The way you tell somebody is really poor around here is they dive for the ditch as they walk along the six lane or carry their Dollar General bags dangling from the handlebars of a bike. I could have/should have done better, but the environment is not structured to help in any way.",
        "Bad society:  People are profit centers to be addicted, robbed and left by the wayside to die an early death.\n\nGood society:  People are valuable and have a right to be nutured, protected, and guided so that they can live fully, purposefully and with dignity without destroying other people, species and the planet itself in the process.\n\nVote red for the first; vote blue for the second.",
        "\"....why do we seek to shame people taking Ozempic but not those who, say, take drugs to lower their blood pressure?\"  \nOh, I don't know... maybe because Ozempic is unavailable to the vast majority of us due to cost?  Right now only the very privileged have access to this wonder drug. And you wonder why we are envious and angry? Geesh... Written truly from the perspective of a privileged user.  Many of us would love to be able to take it but it is unavailable to us.",
        "This is a namby-pamby polemic against American capitalism. \n\nThe American fossil-fuel-based industrial food production and processing industry feeds the world. It also makes us rich. Well, some of us. \n\nThe fact that it fattens us up and then kills us is besides the point. Profit is the point. \n\nIt's that single-minded focus on profit that has made the world what it is today.",
        "And then they took full-fat dairy and other whole products\u2014eggs, meat\u2014 that create satiety away from kids!",
        "Another example of people refusing to take personal responsibility for themselves.  Sure, blame the big, bad food industry for your poor choices.  The food industry works like every other capitalistic industry in this country, which is they they figure out how to give us what we will pay for.  If people would quit buying the trash and instead buy healthy real natural food, guess what, the food industry would figure out how to supply it to us.  Next we will blame the big, bad drug industry for supplying us the horrible weight loss drugs, but, guess what, there are obviously a lot of people that would rather use weight loss drugs than eat healthy food and exercise..."
