        "From the right and in the self-styled libertarian quarter we hear an endless refrain about the evils of 'big government' and the 'nanny state' along with hearty choruses proclaiming that  'government bureaucrats are incompetent.'  When government effectively describes and defines a public health risk: 'La, la, la, I can't hear you.'  We have met the enemy and he is us.",
        "This is another prime example of the evolution of knowledge and confirmation of how little we know in the grand scheme of threats to our health.",
        "If it can be supported at all, the only benefit for beverage ethanol is as a social lubricant.  With a 2025 projection of 8,231,613,070 souls on this planet, we need a little something to all get along.\nA simple message of not drinking alone is a good step forward.\nPut that message on the cans of swill and see if we're better off in a year.",
        "Interesting how people seem to be surprised by the strong reactions. Anyone who doesn't drink and goes out regularly could tell you that this topic provokes all sorts of defensiveness, mocking, and awkward self-denigration (\"I wish I had that much self control\" etc... I'm not judging you! That's not what this is!).",
        "Drinking, COVID, vaccinations\u2026 the admonition to \u201cfollow the science\u201d leads you to clarity. \n\nAs in the case of the huge group of Public Health physicians who oppose RFK\u2019s appointment to head the FDA, and the smaller (but still significant) group of well regarded physicians who support it. \n\nThe saying \u201cwhen you have a watch you know what time it is, when you have two watches you don\u2019t know what time it is\u201d comes to mind.",
        "Ok, have a seat, I've got some news. Drinking is bad for you.\n\nWhat a huge surprise.  \n\nHave you ever had a hangover only to roll over and be surprised by who you're sharing the bed with?\n\nAnd maybe that surprise is indeed a pleasant one.\n\nAnd that's how I met your mother, kids.",
        "Bottom line ... which human nature is instinctively unwilling and thus incapable of accepting is that - plain and simple - alcohol is a poison. Now I may sound like Carrie Nation in preaching that, but it's veery simply the God's honest fact and truth. One way, or most like likely, in many ways, sooner or later it'll get ya. Case - and regrettably most minds - closed but that's the truth of it",
        "Our brains are full of industrial microplastics, and yet we get scolded about drinking? The politics in this country are based on being sanctimonious about other people's behaviors.",
        "All of the questions the author raises (\u201cis this example more carcinogenic that that example? How quickly does it get worse? Do we really know for absolute certain about xyz?\u201d) are just her brain\u2019s attempt to protect her from an upsetting truth.",

        "ALERT: the Surgeon General informs us that consuming a toxin is unhealthy.",
        "There's a very good answer: don't.",
        "No good answers for sure.\n\nAnd the research dollars aren't being spent to find answers. Look at the NIH budget.\n\nMy numbers are not current enough to cite but it's pathetic.\n\nCould it be that the alcohol beverage industry doesn\u2019t want it solved?\n\nAnd what about all those taxes on the sale of alcohol.\n\nFollow the money.",
        "With all that\u2019s going on in the world, why does the Times insist on these nanny-like \u201cyou\u2019re not eating right\u201d articles? So much hand-wringing over alcohol lately. Even the tone-deaf and ineffective to the point of being no -present Surgeon General has felt the need to weigh in on it.\n\nWho cares? We all do and consume things that may bode ill for our health. And those who eat right and exercise regularly still run the risk of being hit by a bus out of the blue. \n\nEXCESSIVE anything is wrong and detrimental to your health. But a few glasses of wine, or a few belts of something harder? Life is too short not to indulge on occasion. Those who still ponder this are denying themselves the comforts of life.",
        "And yet I\u2019m still going to do exactly as I please about this and other things, such as not worrying about my \u201cemissions\u201d. The word \u201cshould\u201d has no meaning for me anymore.",
        "The studies of the deleterious affect of drinking alcohol are not scientifically designed and they certainly aren't peer reviewed.  Seems to  me that the Pharmaceutical Companies are promoting abstinence from alcohol so that they can sell people medications to combat the difficulties of living in the 21st century. Having practiced malpractice law for almost 50 years I am not inclined to believe anything that they are promoting.\n\nConsider this in all things that you do:\n\nIn Act 3 of Pygmalion Eliza commenting on her father's habits says:\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Do you mean that he drank?\n\nLIZA. Drank! My word! Something chronic.\n\nMRS. EYNSFORD HILL. How dreadful for you!\n\nLIZA. Not a bit. It never did him no harm what I could see. But then he did not keep it up regular. [Cheerfully] On the burst, as you might say, from time to time. And always more agreeable when he had a drop in. When he was out of work, my mother used to give him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until he\u2019d drunk himself cheerful and loving-like. There\u2019s lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with. [Now quite at her ease] You see, it\u2019s like this. If a man has a bit of a conscience, it always takes him when he\u2019s sober; and then it makes him low-spirited. A drop of booze just takes that off and makes him happy.\n\nNow tell me, why would anyone give up occasional drinking because of some scientific study nonsense?",
        "As noted in comments on last week\u2019s article on drinking in middle age, the NYT coverage of the risks of moderate drinking has been surprisingly and disappointingly one-sided. The Surgeon General\u2019s report has received a great deal of attention, but the equally recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine has been virtually ignored. NASEM\u2019s conclusions are very different than those of the Surgeon General, and the following does a reasonable job of presenting information that we are not getting from the NYT:\n<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/01/08/why-we-are-still-arguing-about-the-health-effects-of-moderate-drinking\" target=\"_blank\">https://reason.com/2025/01/08/why-we-are-still-arguing-about-the-health-effects-of-moderate-drinking</a>/",
        "Either way, chance of dying is 100%, so an individual cost-benefit analysis is probably in order.   How much pleasure do you derive from alcohol?  How miserable would you be without it?  How important is longevity?  Would you be doing something even more dangerous (like driving) if you weren't drinking?",
        "In what way is this \"politically motivated\"?",
        "People acting on the Surgeon General\u2019s warning will save lives. Scoff all you want.",
        "Was the angst over tobacco warning labels as ridiculous as all this? Did smokers counter with claims like \u201cbut nicotine speeds up the heart, like a workout\u201d \u2014 much like current drinkers reaching for justifications like \u201cbut booze reduces stress, which is good.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s politically fashionable on the right to discredit science and facts, but many drinkers on the left are joining the refrain because they don\u2019t like where the evidence on alcohol leads. Politics isn\u2019t just local, these days it\u2019s personal.",
        "Sorry, but I do not believe it is this simple, the people of Central Sardinia, religiously drink wine from the  Cannonau grape and have some of the highest live expectancy in the world.",
        "there are no clear prospective studies to confirm the Surgeon General's statement.  I can accept it as his opinion.  nothing more.  How about his opinion on glyphosates,  PCBs , PFAS ?He may have received a good education ,  but perhaps he lacks common sense?  Time for him to reassess his priorities.\n\n\n\nsigned Mai Ting MD",
        "Nobody wants to hear bad news about their bad habits.  This reminds me if the three stages of truth. ridicule, violent opposition, and acceptance as self evident.",
        "Bizarre. There\u2019s nothing good in alcohol except profits from misery.",
        "Another misleading opinion on the issue, just like the highly politicized irresponsible take on the matter. Neither are worth anything because they omit, likely by design, key facts such as risk of these cancers without alcohol. Some napkin math indicates that over ten years indicates that the risk is in the 0.025% percent range. That is a pretty small risk. Over thirty years, it is a bit higher but still around a tenth of a percent. What do you get when you double a very small number? You get a another really small number.",
        "Lots of virtue signaling on here. \"I did this/that and therefore I am holier than you, I chose not to drink alcohol.\"\n\nI like food and wine together and sometimes just wine. I am an adult who can handle it, I do not feel sorry for those of you in need of a nanny.",

        "Alcohol is poison! Stop drinking it! Especially, affluent NYT readers, please stop drinking expensive high-end wine from California. Thanks to you abstemious former drinkers, the bottom has fallen out of the high-end wine market in California and excellent Napa and Sonoma wineries are selling their grapes out the back door for pennies on the dollar to folks like Trader Joe's who then bottle and sell TJ's Platinum Reserve Atlas Peak, Howell Mountain, Rutherford and more to the rest of us for under $20/bottle. Many thanks!",
        "Enough of this anti-alcohol nonsense, the auld Gray Lady is turning into a Debbie Downer. If there\u2019s an adult on the planet that doesn\u2019t realize that booze  is bad for you I\u2019ll eat my Bud Light cap. Let\u2019s have some bits about what\u2019s good for mind, body and soul. I\u2019ll drink to that.",
        "I'm 53, I stopped drinking completely 16 months ago. I was finding that even 2-3 drinks would make me way too drunk, so the best option was to quit altogether. I have to say in many ways my life is worse without drinking. No hangovers, regrets, shame (at least related to drinking too much), but my life is a lot more boring and less fun, and just feels smaller. I feel like there's no point in meeting friends at a bar, so I don't. I've skipped a few parties too. I don't really miss drinking, but I do feel that if everyone else will be drinking at an event, there's not much point in going. I appreciate mocktails at restaurants but they seem kind of dumb in a way. I also have not seen many of the supposed benefits - I don't have more energy and I don't think I have a sunnier outlook on life. I'm not planning to drink ever again, but it does kind of suck. Oh well.",
        "In the new age of AI, it should not be too difficult to assess the cost to society of treating the cancers that alcohol causes and then levy a tax on every ounce of alcohol that is old to make up the difference.\n\nThe ignorant can drink their lives away and society does not have to pay for their stupidity.\n\nThe same can be done with many other societal costs that add nothing to cohesion or improvement but are allowed to flourish despite their harms.\n\nWe already know that prohibition does not work.  Try economics and the free market.",
        "All good information and it comes down to a personal choice.\n\nFor me, alcohol is social and having a few drinks with friends on the weekend is very pleasurable.  I suspect that as The Felon comes into the White House and starts tearing down our institutions, alcohol use will rise.",
        "I mean\u2026moderation.\n\nFasting isn\u2019t just a Christian discipline. The point of it is to bring out your demons so your can confront them. \n\nIf your drinking far too much, chances are there is something you\u2019re trying to numb, forget, or run away from\u2026it\u2019s what you eventually have to confront in AA. \n\nFast from alcohol and find out what it is.",

        "Cancer epidemiologist here. Cancer is well over 100 different diseases with different risk factors, including genetics. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) based out of Lyon, France classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen (meaning they are certain). More information about cancer and the complexities of determining carcinogenicity can be found on this American Cancer Society website <a href=\"https://cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html</a>",
        "Journalists reporting on this subject should review LaConte et al., for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. If you look at the actual data, on p3/Table 1, what it shows is a trivial difference in cancer risk between light drinkers and non-drinkers (in fact light drinkers have a lower risk of colorectal and larynx cancer). The cancer risk for moderate drinkers is not particularly great for liver and colorectal cancer although it is statistically significant.\n\n<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112463\" target=\"_blank\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112463</a>/\n\nAnother one, from Cao et al (2015) in The British Medical Journal (BMJ) says \u201cLight to moderate drinking is associated with small and non-significant increased risk of cancer.\u201d (p8/col1).\n\n<a href=\"https://bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4238\" target=\"_blank\">https://bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4238</a>\n\nHeavy drinkers have much higher cancer risks and if you aggregate their risks with the others (which should not be done), you get an overall higher risk. The Cao study also notes that smoking hasn\u2019t been well controlled for in the studies (with heavy drinkers being more likely to smoke).\n\nSo as I read it, light to moderate drinking isn\u2019t much of a risk. I\u2019d be more worried about all of the plastic in our food and other contaminants.",

        "My, my, the NYT is certainly intent on ruining my nightly cocktail with copious \"alcohol will be the end of me\" pieces; the exception is this well-written article. Balanced and reasonable. \nI am suspect about all sky is falling studies after living through scares ad nauseum; red wine is good /bad for us, vitamins are good/bad/urinated away, chocolate is beneficial except those pesky metals, plastic bags help the planet by saving trees until plastic bags were deemed harmful to the environment, butter VS margarine, full-fat dairy is fine/not fine, etc.\nSo I will continue to enjoy my (one) nightly drink, eat whole foods and cook all my meals except the occasional meal out, move my body, reach out to loved ones and enjoy the community that is the NYT comments section.",
        "Thank you for this. \n\nA couple of things to keep in mind:\n1. Mice are not humans.\n2. There is a tendency, especially among people suffering from alcoholism and those close to them, to view all drinking as addiction, and to get quite insistent about this. While I understand the fear and other strong emotion coming from the havoc that addiction has wrought in their lives, most people who drink wine, spirits, etc. are not downing it in quantity. They just enjoy it now and then. It's the difference between Supersize Me and going to Burger King for a kid's birthday. So a sense of proportion about a thing that people have been doing for millennia would be helpful.",
        "Why do people push back so hard against an absolute risk? Science evolves over time. We evolve over time. As Americans we also live in a gross capitalist economy that pushes us to spend money and here is an example of the power of the alcohol industry. Let\u2019s stop!",
        "Twenty five years ago it was widely reported that moderate wine consumption promoted heart health.  This gave license to every retiree to stock up on two buck Chuck even if wine was not their fancy.  The purveyors of this myth owe society an apology and substantial reparations.",
        "[The advisory relies on decades of epidemiologic studies and experiments testing what happens to mice who are given alcohol. (The poor, drunk mice develop tumors.) It\u2019s a synthesis of information gathered across time, nations and many hundreds of thousands of people.]\n\nI'd like to see a link to this study. Were the doses given the mice comparable, per unit of body weight, to the amounts of alcohol humans take in during normal drinking?",
        "The SG and the rest of the neo-Temperance doctors would have much more credibility if they had also called for cancer warning labels on baked goods,  red meat, bar b que, and breakfast sausage.  Where were the calls for Diabetes warning labels on giant cups of artificially  sweetened soda and boxes of doughnuts.  This is what makes them unbelievable.  A fad de jour or advocating their own moral position.  Yes for some people some level of alcohol is dangerous.  But this obsession above all other health harms including over reliance on prescribed  pharmaceuticals for behavior and depression is mystifying.",
        "It seems the author's main point turns on a straw man argument. Who is saying, \"No amount of alcohol is safe\" is a prescription? It doesn't sound anything like a prescription.",
        "Also, look at our dangerous American ULTRA-PROCESSED food diet (meats, soda, Doritos, Oreos, GIRL SCOUT cookies!, etc.); talk about risky business.",
        "I have 1 or 2 drinks a month. I will continue to do so. The risk of driving anywhere or eating contaminated food, or seriously injuring myself falling down the stairs or in the shower,or getting mugged, or struck by lightning, or being co-lateral damage in a shooting, or being shot in an intentional shooting do not stop me from driving, eating, showering, driving, or walking around in town.",

        "The crazy prices for a glass of wine at restaurants has got us cutting down. We still buy a bottle - maybe once a month. The $16/glass + tax + tip has been a great deterrent.\n\nWe miss the \"cheers\" at Sunday \"date brunch\" and now do it with our glass of water.",
        "Is beer less carcinogenic as wine or hard liquor? It feels like it would be.",
        "The elephant in the room is the fact that the legal hard drug alcohol is so powerful, a very small percent \ncan get you high, and people love the high.  Drug use is basically, for most people, relief from various levels of stress everyone goes through.  Thus, vocations with higher stress levels have higher rates of alcoholism - doctors, lawyers, priests, judges.\nA very sick charade has been going on directing people to the worst drug by not calling it a drug and stigmatizing all others.",
        "It's interesting that people can't just treat the advisory as just that, an advisory.  A point of information they can use to make decisions, rather than a judgment or a threat to their lifestyles.  It seems to me that more information, whether it's about science and health, or history, or whatever else, is a good thing as long as the person on the receiving end can think critically about it.  Apparently that's a disappearing skill, though.",
        "Many of the middle-aged, hyper-educated people I know who have \"quit\" now use a lot more marijuana than they did before they stopped drinking. \n\nModern life is hard, people like mild intoxicants, both are ok in moderation if you pay attention to the percentages; we just shouldn't fool ourselves that alcohol abstinence always mean abstinence from everything.",
        "Do some drink only to drown their sorrows or cope with life? Sure they do. Some also drink to share stories, and enjoy the company of friend\u2019s. I enjoy drink culture paired with good travel or delicious food. I don\u2019t feel bad about it.",
        "Maybe the messaging is hard to get right. But, there has been, due to some not so good science, the impression that red wine consumption is very good for you. To me the science progressed and we have been given the results of better studies. People can do what they want with the new info.",
        "I went to college in Ireland and Appalachia. In my 20s, I was an EMT, a nursing student, and a bartender in dive pubs. I am keenly aware of alcohol's effects on both those who consume it and the people around them. \n\nI'm now in my thirties and you couldn't pay me to drink it.",
        "What annoys me is the fact that, as always, there is an attempt to (at best well meaningly) get women's attention or (at worst in bad faith) scare them into submission by focusing on and playing up the risk of breast cancer in particular whether it is actually the biggest health risk under discussion or not, because it is presumed that this is what women fear most and are most likely to believe they will get and die from even if it actually isn't. As if women don't also have livers etc?",
        "Alcohol is the wonder drug.  It's strength is so deep and wide in our world that normal thinking doesn't apply to it.  It's not(even in this piece) called a drug\n(deadly and addictive)and with all scorn and laws directed at other drugs, enjoys a monopoly in recreational drugs and with opiate scare tactics \ndenying people pain killers, gets even more customers for pain relief.",
        "Alcohol is a carcinogen. Tobacco is a carcinogen. Yet, governments everywhere have legalized their sale to adults. In FY2023, the federal government collected $11.1 billion in excise tax from the sale of spirits, wine, and beer. States make money too. However, the total economic cost of alcohol use disorder is estimated to be around $249 billion in 2023. The cost of alcohol-related liver disease will more than double from $31 billion in 2022 to $66 billion by 2040. These numbers show a staggering burden on economic growth, and the only way the government can reduce it is by increasing the excise tax to levels that makes consuming alcohol financially impossible for the general population.",
        "I have not had a drink in over 20 years, after decades of plentiful alcohol consumption. I think it might be extremely helpful if this or another study could illustrate a correlation between say cancer and the volume of alcohol consumed.Convincing moderate drinkers to consume less might have some individual health benefits, but little overall societal effects. But anything that might have an influence on excessive drinkers might have a dramatic societal effect. For starters, imagine the lives saved by a reduction in drunken drivers.",
        "There are no good reasons to drink alcohol except for the obvious ones. Each individual can choose to drink or not based on that advice alone, but we should recognize that these kind of warnings will only scare away the people who are already low-level consumers (1-2 drinks a day, 3-4 times a week) but not the real problem drinkers (5  everyday). We can\u2019t solve societal issues, like alcohol-related illnesses and drunk driving, with regulations alone. MADD and AA have done more for us than any tax or warning label.",
        "My thanks to the author who discusses the risk with a good bit of balance. The ending is a good comfort too. I also felt a red scare about all these recent reports, because I have enjoyed a good amount of drinking in my life (2 dry Januarys aside.). Like an avid artist says, \"I should be creating a little more,\" an avid drinker says, \"I should be drinking a little less.\" Desire frames deep inner drives.\n\nStatistical studies are not the way for everyone - people have a power in themselves to some extent to choose to be outliers. And this new year we would all do well to remember that. Similarly, do we know how many deaths are related to scary statistics? \n\nThis movement has been gaining steam because it was already there with the young people. I work around a lot of young to mid 20's folk, and their attitudes are not at all like past generations. They clearly see alcohol as more of a risk, to their bodies and from the law and for potentially getting in any of the top 10 life-changing accidents that come from making a decision when you're too drunk. \n\nSomehow they just say \"nah\" without feeling like they are missing out! A dying breed, we people in dark bars who feel that pub village warmth among strangers; and raise a glass to say, \"well my life is getting shorter, but noticeably cheerier!\"\n\nA statistics-driven life doesn't like that kind of thinking at all... but they have plenty of other new drugs to choose from, too.",
        "I think the surgeon general has overstepped with this warning. None of the data is a surprise, and fhe actual direct incidence of getting cancer from drinking alcohol still looks specious to me. We all know that many substances and conditions in our life can cause cancer - Excessive consumption of. Retain types of food, smoking, even the sun causes cancer if you get too much of it. \nI think this was unnecessary.",
        "Yes, I think everyone that reads this paper understands that alcohol is harmful--- but most of us have a drink (or two, or). Aside from the taste, people like the so-called 'booze-buzz' (even if they don't admit it).  \n\nThat noted--- do we really need a warning label on a bottle of wine, beer or hard liquor?  Will it cause one to turn away at the liquor store?   The debate can go on and on, but facts are facts.  Will a warning label change minds about having that drink?  \n\nMaybe that why alcoholic beverages are sometimes referred to as 'devils water.'",
        "I simply don't understand this new temperance movement.  As many commenters have noted, people invented beer before they invented bread.  Alcohol has been a part of human culture since there was such a thing as human culture.  It's an enjoyable part of the lives of many, and people aren't going to stop, especially when the same people who are warning us about alcohol consumption are all but begging us to use marijuana.  The hypocrisy is palpable.  I have a martini every night, and a glass of wine with dinner.  It's a wonderful part of my day and I'm not going to stop.",
        "Sure there's a good answer.  Don't do it or suffer the consequences.",
        "I am waiting for the warning labels to appear on cannabis products. When you buy a bottle of wine, you know what's in it and what it does to you. The same cannot be said of the foul-smelling substance that people are smoking all over the place. What is the effect of marijuana-smoking on the lungs? No evidence that it causes cancer?  That's not the same as evidence that it doesn't cause cancer. To find evidence, you have to be willing to look for it. There's also no way to test for it when people are driving under the influence. There is no pot breathalyzer   Marijuana is in vogue and alcohol is out among the progressive set. It's become the drug of choice among tax farmers in state capitols who seek to legalize it for their own nefarious purposes.",
        "I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice: \"Everything in moderation.\"  My grandparents were born and/or raised in the late 1890s/early 1900s and all lived to their mid- to late- 90s. All drank copious amounts of alcohol, none had cancer. \n\nThat alcohol may cause cancer is not a big surprise. Clearly, there are other factors these days which are increasing the likelihood of getting cancer - pesticide exposure, smog, smoking, exposure to 2nd hand smoke, sex, eating highly processed foods, etc. etc..

        "I'm working on a piece about this so I read this with fascination. My expertise, however, is cultural not medical. I see alcohol ingrained in society in a way smoking never was. People don't smoke to celebrate occasions despite old Hollywood movies (\"Now, Voyager's\" memorably tearjerking final scene) or the proverbial cigar passed on the birth of a baby. People drink. It's older than the Bible, which contains Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana. Think Dionysus/Bacchus in Greco-Roman culture.\n\nHere, however, it's instructive to remember that what made smoking ubiquitous -- apart from the addictive nicotine -- was marketing. Those glamorous Hollywood movies, those terrific ads (the Marlboro man) and commercials (for Virginia Slims, once sponsor of the fledgling Women's Tennis Association and a champion of the 1970s women's movement; and for Lark cigarettes, brilliantly set to Rossini's \"William Tell\" overture.\n\nWhat did in smoking was marketing as well. The antismoking movement figured out that you fight an idea with a better idea and you could do it, because the FCC mandated that anyone with an opposing viewpoint to an ad deserved equal time.\n\nSo this fight is not just medical and political. It is ultimately cultural and in the long run -- as Prohibition proved -- liquor is going to be more difficult to control. -- thegamesmenplay.com",

        "Up until drinking water was universally safe, people consumed staggering amounts of alcohol as a matter of course.  They died younger than we do for reasons probably not related to alcohol.  Our longer life expectancy pretty much insures that anyone who doesn't succumb to a heart attack or stroke will get cancer.  The questions are what kind, is it curable, and is treatment readily and easily available to most?  The last question is the one that should dominate any public policy discussion regarding health.  \n\nThis article evokes a \"well duh, alcohol causes cancer\" response in me.  I wonder what motivated the study to begin with.  Lots of things cause cancer.  Avoid exposure to fertilizers, weed killers, paints and solvents, cleaning products, new car interiors (!), etc., etc., and drink in moderation, sure, why not.  Some people who go swimming in the ocean will surely drown.  Some people who use power tools will lose a finger.  Some people who drink alcohol will get cancer as a direct result of drinking alcohol while most will surely suffer a hangover.",

The alcohol advisory is likely only one in an evolving history of landmark public health documents about the dangers of drinking; it\u2019s a document for the archives as well as the moment.\n\nI appreciate most these last sentences. The Surgeon General's request for the labeling is a quiet, non defensive, ask to alert the public -on an alcohol bottle- to the fact that alcohol is a carcinogen. Full stop.  It is a carcinogen.\n\nHow we respond to this fact will vary, of course.

        "Another layer of complication is in how people understand what a carcinogen is. Not all carcinogens cause cancer all the time. Everyone has an anecdotal example of this (grandpa smoked and drank til he was 100!) and that often speaks more loudly than the statistical data. If I remember correctly, when I studied toxicology long ago it was explained to me that carcinogens are a numbers game - the more you are exposed the more your chances of cancer go up, but those chances are never necessarily 100% and they might be zero if the other variables necessary for a cancer to take hold are not present. In contrast to other kinds of impacts where the dose corresponds to the degree of severity (\"the dose makes the poison\") - which itself can be turned on its head for people with chemical sensitivity.  Alcohol behaves as both - the cancer risk is a matter of chance, but if you consume too much at once, the acute poisoning will definitely happen, no exceptions. Now that I'm 51 and have almost stopped drinking (well, relatively), it's the acute impacts that helped make the choice.  I feel so much better, and that's self-reinforcing.

But this article is also a case of the old cliche \"liars figure and figures lie.\" I'm referring to the mention that women's drinking one drink a day increases the risk of breast cancer by 10 percent. This is misleading. The actual figure is female teetotalers have 10 percent risk of breast cancer. Whereas women who consume one drink a day have an 11 percent chance. This is statistically insignificant. To highlight the way this sort of figure misleads take a hypothetical. Let's say that women who do not consume orange juice have a one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) chance of getting breast cancer, and let's say women who drink orange juice have a 1 percent chance of getting breast cancer. That would be an increase of 100 percent for the risk of breast cancer. But this statistic is clearly absurd. The increase (if real, which it is not) would be statistically insignificant. So how statistics are presented matter. To say women who have one drink a day increase their risk of cancer by 10 percent is misleading and bordering on fear mongering.",
        "This whole argument about how many days you lose by drinking alcohol is verging on the ridiculous.  I don't think anyone thinks that drinking alcohol is great for your health.  We all understand that moderation in just about everything is best.  There are literally hundreds of things we do that increase our risk of cancer or dying.  The focus on a few glasses of wine which make life nicer for many is a stupendous waste of time and resources.",

My dear husband is 67 years old and has not eaten solid food since 2021, when he underwent radiation for throat cancer, 2 years after we were married. He's doing the best he can with his feeding tube and all the other indiginities of cancer survivorship.\nHe was a lover of beer and beermaking back before we met. \nHowever in order to marry me, he agreed to abstain completely from alcohol, because it killed my first husband. Alcoholism slowly destroyed his wellbeing, his career, his family and finally finished him off, alone in his apartment.\nFor every person chiming in on how alcohol is a necessary part of a balanced life, there is a person who feels a lurch of disgust and sadness while passing the spectacle of the beverage aisle of the grocery store.",

I'm not a doctor, but my body tells me those two modes of consumption are quite different in terms of the physical effect.

        "I quit drinking alcohol last year after years and years of drinking much more than I should. I find the discussion about whether or not drinking is bad for you and how that is communicated to be all done in bad faith. We know drinking is bad for you. There are people who claim it isn't, but they're just lying to themselves (or they work for InBev). But knowing drinking is bad for you isn't going to change people's behavior. I didn't drink because I thought it was ok, I drank because it felt good, and especially when I was poor, I had few comforts in life and this one managed to relieve some social stress as well.\nThe surgeon general is absolutely correct that drinking alcohol is bad for you and can lead to cancer. If that statement bothers you, you should be considering what forces in your life are leading to the statement bothering you more than you're thinking about the statement itself. If you think that this is simple and you just don't drink alcohol, I'm glad that works for you, but you shouldn't be assuming that works for everyone.  Drinking, in many cases, is cultural, and it's aggravated by being addictive. Recovery from addiction is hard and not a uniform process. It has, so far, been easier for me than for many others. I'm lucky about that.

Your other lifestyle choices are probably far more important than your drinking at that level. \n\nThe reality is that there are many people who say they enjoy \u201ca glass\u201d with dinner or who drink \u201csocially,\u201d but who, when being honest, know they drink a great deal more. These guidelines that imply some magic division, where 14 units a week are healthy, but some arbitrary greater amount means you are an at risk problem drinker, encourage people to be dishonest with themselvesabout a substance that many struggle to perfectly control. \n\nThese updated guidelines reflect that alcohol is basically a toxic substance. If you can really limit yourself to small amounts, then it\u2019s just one of life\u2019s many risks. If you know deep down that you struggle to take it or leave it, then stop fooling yourself that you are close to healthy limits and this isn\u2019t harmful.",

The threat to mental health in the nature of the more dis-inhibiting actions of those drinking is a problem as well.\n\nIf one does not talk of chronic disease, there is a substantial aggregate effect on mortality to the drinker or those about her or him or them to the extent of the risks of the outcomes from such dis-inhibited behaviors. \n\nOne has to look at all mortality or morbidity and not merely at cancer or other classical medical disease.

This is also true for the adults in the drinkers' lives though they have more agency and can leave if necessary. I bartended in my early to mid twenties, and my customers loved me, but being the only sober person around a bunch of intoxicated people is no fun. They don\u2019t even have to be drunk to be trying to handle. So much repressed sadness comes to the surface when people \u201clet loose\u201d it\u2019s heartbreaking. Just ask the designated sober friend. I decided to stop drinking for my own health but also for the people around me, and it wasn\u2019t difficult but I did have to find other coping mechanisms. Now I make sure to see friends and family earlier in the day, before too much alcohol takes all the fun out of our evening (and after a while it does). I see highly intelligent people try to explain away the damage alcohol is slowly causing in their lives, not open to any alternatives. I don\u2019t preach but it\u2019s truly heartbreaking.",

        "Whether or not to drink alcohol is every adult\u2019s choice to make unless they have health or religious reasons to avoid alcohol entirely. But it is essential to continue the research on the effects of alcohol consumption and provide as much information as possible to the public, including warning labels on alcohol-containing products, so that people can make informed decisions based on science not folklore. It is vital to educate young people about the effects of alcohol on developing bodies, especially developing brains, so they can make informed choices rather than be influenced by peer pressure and intense industry marketing. And the public\u2019s eyes should not be shielded from information about the perennial death and morbidity resulting from alcohol consumption.",

        "It seems that suddenly there are daily articles about the risks of alcohol, even for those of us who drink moderately. I wonder how studies can separate the many many factors that might lead to a person getting cancer. We have a nation of nearly 50% overweight or obese people. We have a nation of people who subsist on processed foods. This seems overblown.",
        "Numerous (and some conflicting studies) suggest that mouthwashes with significant alcohol content raise the risk of certain oral cancers. Another area that requires more study or precaution (take your pick).",
        "The difference between science and journalism is the presence of a denominator. As stated, the Surgeon General has pointed to alcohol use being implicated as the main cause of 100,000 cases of can er and 20,000 deaths per year in the USA. But the total number of new cancer cases is about 2 million per year, and about 650,000 deaths.  I could not find that information in any article about the Surgeon General\u2019s recommendation, but it\u2019s readily available on line.  So whether alcohol consumption\u2019s modest contribution to total cancer incidence and mortality is worth a change in lifestyle seems like an individual risk-benefit decision.  But the failure of journalists to perform even simple due diligence is disappointing, though not unexpected.",

        "It might behoove us to look around at different states and countries to see what works. They could try raising the tax on it, like they did with cigarettes. But it would have to be across the board. Here in Washington, some years ago, we voted to privatize the liquor stores, with the promise that it would bring prices down. It didn't. Spirits are taxed more than beer and wine, for some reason. So people load up if they're in a neighboring state or at duty free. The cost of booze in Iceland is quite prohibitive. I'm not sure if it inhibits consumption. I brought my own when I visited there and paid as much as $18 for a pint of ale, just to try it, so anecdotally, I'd guess it might help. Utah used to limit the percentage of alcohol in beer and made it very inconvenient to go out for a drink. You had to be a member of a club or something. But those prudish abstemious ways have faced serious pushback. What we need is data, including on whether warning labels might help.",
        "Put me in the category of 'roll my eyes', and for good reason.  Here's why.  From the other article where absolute risk increase is discussed:  \n\n\"The absolute risk of breast cancer over a woman\u2019s life span is about 11.3 percent (11 out of 100) for those who have less than a drink a week.\n\nThe risk increases to 13.1 percent (13 of 100 individuals) at one drink a day, and up to 15.3 percent (15 of 100) at two drinks per day.\n\nFor men, the absolute risk of developing an [potentially] alcohol-related cancer increases from about 10 percent (10 of every 100 individuals) for those who consume less than one drink a week to 11.4 percent (11 per 100) for those who have a drink every day on average. It rises to 13 percent (13 of 100 individuals) for those who have two drinks a day on average.\"\n\nTHIS is the kind of information, and the ONLY kind of information that helps people logically assess their own risk.  So, any article discussing whether there are 'any good answers' should have included it.  And nearly everyone who reads these numbers and understands them would roll their eyes.  The increase is just not significant enough for me to be concerned.",
        "While it is true that alcohol consumption causes health problems, it seems that this one \u201cvice\u201d is being singled out without the necessary criteria to do so. \n\nWhat are our goals as a society? Do we want to minimize cancer? Minimize expensive healthcare that results from individuals\u2019 decisions to drink? Minimize human suffering? We need clear goals and criteria then we need to assess all carcinogens against it. Why alcohol and not soda? What about excessive sugar? What about trans fats? What about carcinogenic food colorings? Is the risk from alcohol so much greater than those risks that it warrants being at the top of the list? If so, then I\u2019m open to the labeling idea. But I suspect otherwise.",
        "I don't understand people who look at the Surgeon General's opinion as \"scolding\" or irrelevant. Grownups are supposed to have the capacity to look things in the face for what they are and make corresponding decisions for themselves. I believe most people can not separate the idea that participating in a habit that is bad for you does not make YOU bad. Their self-identity is that they know better than to do things that are bad for them, and can not reconcile that that is not true. You can do things that are bad for you without guilt or explanation! \n\nTake a hard look inside, do what you want, and quit blaming the messenger.",
        "Do we have to look at everything through a political lens now?  Murthy is the Surgeon General and part of his role is to advise Americans on health risks.  \n\nIt is clear that drinking increases risks for certain cancers.  My mother started drinking heavily later in life and died of esophageal cancer.  I have been tested and have a precancerous condition known as Barrett's esophagus and knowing that alcohol increases my risk was one factor that led me to stop drinking altogether a few years back.\n\nLike everything, this is a personal choice but warning people of the risk is the right call.",

That's a scientific fact.\n\nIt's a social lubricant many people enjoy and has a powerful emotional and financial lobby behind it.

And even for others as a toxin it carries a risk of damage in ever increasing ways.\n\nDeciding to drink or not is a choice. If there is a risk attached to that choice, people should know about it.\n\nThis is not complex.",
        "The proposed warning seems more about scolding than information. How dare you buy that bottle of wine?\n\nThere are several good reasons to cut back and in some instances stop drinking. But the basis of the warning is recent studies that contradict studies that were conducted not long ago and peer-reviewed. And in the list of habits affecting adversely our health, social use--and perhaps even moderate use--of alcohol seems close to the bottom. Those rich people who love their wine and the treadmill are going to outlive those who never touch a drop and are much too heavy and inactive.\n\nMy own feelings are there is risk in nearly everything, look to other cultures and history, and embrace in all things moderation, whether wine or food or going to church.

        "This article gives proper perspective to the recent Surgeon General Advisory. As most things in our competitive media environment, we get clickbait and fear rather than perspective. If science demonstrates a causal connection between booze and cancer then, of course, we should know that. But life has all sorts of risks and it's up to each of us to assess those risks. As an older guy who chose not to drink alcohol 35 yeras ago, I've concluded that everybody engages in one or more activities that make them feel better. Some are healthier than others. Paradoxically, many of us are trying to avoid anxiety (fear, worry etc) and there's nothing more fear-provoking than being constantly reminded that we're living our lives imperfectly. Perfect is always the enemy of the good. Relax and enjoy your people for you shall be dead before you know it.",
        "The elephant in the room, it seems to me, is that most Americans fill shopping carts every day with foods that lead straight to diabetes, heart disease, and there can hardly be a doubt: quite a bit of cancer. I'm sure there aren't studies on this, but my guess is that the percentage of daily calories derived from heavily processed foods, full of preservatives and other additives, is enormous. Some people could find it a little strange that there could be a warning for Puligny-Montrachet, which is fermented grape juice, but not Doritos or Cinnamon Toast Crunch; when it's pretty clear to any sentient being which one is the greater health risk.",
        "For those of us who do not drink in order to \"change our mood,\" or to calm down after a stressful day, but have a scant half a glass of wine every few days at dinner because we like the taste, or in summer split a small bottle of beer with spouse over barbecued hamburgers, the fuss over our kind of drinking seems overblown. \n\nI know why most of my family died of various cancers: bad genes and smoking, or bad genes and a combination of smoking and nightly cocktails. Living on Long Island and being exposed to pesticides and herbicides and drinking water from wells affected by years of DDT over potato fields couldn't have helped  either.\n\nI also ride subways and on occasion take car trips. Both are considered dangerous by many. At 70, I still climb ladders to do house chores, climb reasonably accessible High Peaks and mountains in Acadia, and shovel snow when it's very cold -- also considered dangerous. \n\nI could do none of these and also not sip a glass of Porto probably three times every winter. Vegetation is not a state I could tolerate for long, though.",
        "The articles about alcohol consumption have been on a nearly daily basis the past few weeks. I\u2019ve no doubt alcohol consumption is not good for you, but meanwhile 40% of Americans are obese, 60% of their diet is ultra processed foods, nearly 40% are completely sedentary. I\u2019d venture to say that this is an even greater public health problem.",
        "There is a good answer.  Actually, there are several good answers.  First of all, if you drink, drink in moderation and never mix drinking and driving.  That same advice ought to apply to being on the phone while driving, hands free or not.  Second, if you think you have a drinking problem, you just might.  Get the help you need and don't drink.  That's not easy in this country because there are a lot people who are insensitive when it comes to non-drinkers.  \n\nLast of all, everything is dangerous if it's overdone.  There is always a chance that something will injure us or kill us, even if it's pleasurable.  It's why we have laws against public drunkeness and drunk driving.  Maybe what needs to change is Americans sense of entitlement to do whatever they want, whenever they want to do it.  \n\nIf you want people to find better ways to handle stress, you need to teach them.  That starts in school and begins at home.  What I've noticed, since I was a child and watched adults drink, is that the pattern of drinking has changed.  People don't nurse their drinks.  They gulp them and have more.  There's often too much alcohol in a drink; it overwhelms the other flavors.  Most of us shouldn't be tipsy after one drink.  \n\nThe best way to change things is using public health ads wisely.  Of course, this being America, it won't happen.",
        "I cut back on my drinking, but not because of the cancer warning which frankly didn\u2019t concern me at all.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: there are many other potential negative health consequences to drinking, including liver damage, accelerated cognitive decline, mood disregulation, and sleep disturbances. The real problem with the surgeon general\u2019s message is he focused on the relatively small increase in cancer risk when he should\u2019ve talked about the big picture. Consequently he\u2019s become the boy who cried wolf.",
        "I've never been a problem drinker and I've been a social drinker for almost 50 years. I recently began to reduce my social drinking because of the effects of alcohol on my sleep and on my mental awareness in the evening. I like the short-term relaxation that an alcohol hit provides, but I don't like the mental haziness and the tiredness that results in me falling asleep too early. I also don't like how alcohol packs on the pounds. As always in life, there are tradeoffs: immediate pleasure vs. longer-term negative side effects. I've decided to think longer-term, and I think I'm on the way to being abstinent almost always or even 100%.",
        "One should exercise judgement and moderation in many things in life, but in our black and white, on/off, you\u2019re for us or against us mentality these days, everything becomes a stark choice.

A lot of things can harm us but, as the ads say, \u201cyour results may vary\u201d.   I don\u2019t think this is anywhere as definitive as the link between smoking and cancer, for instance.  If you\u2019re drinking too much or engaging in binge drinking, should you reevaluate your choices?  Yes, it sounds like it, and not just due to cancer risks.  If you\u2019re having a glass of wine with dinner a few nights per week, should you stop? Personally (and that\u2019s my situation), no thanks - the chances of that evening meal time ritual making any significant impact on my health and longevity versus the hundred other things that might kill me are so indeterminate and minor they\u2019re not worth cutting that little bit off.",

        "We humans have used alcohol, and other psychoactive substances not for their health benefits, but as ways to enhance enjoyment of life. Individuals should have the freedom to make that choice based on their own absolute and relative risks. Unlike drunk driving that can cause harm to others increased risk of cancer affects only the individuals and perhaps their loved ones.  \n\nThe Surgeon General's Advisory is focused on reducing societal burden by reducing overall incidence of cancers. That should not be politicized or interpreted as an infringement on our freedoms. It is an advisory and not coercion by the Government.",
        "\u201cNo good answers,\u201d the headline reads. What? There\u2019s a great answer: put alcohol in the category where it belongs, alongside cocaine, opiates, and methamphetamines, all of which have similar risk profiles. They all have great medical value when used wisely, and are all fun to consume, rarely and in moderation. All these substances, when produced by professionals in a quality controlled environment, present similar levels of danger, and medical professionals have high rates of use, in part because they know this. The fundamental problem is that we don\u2019t take alcohol with the seriousness it deserves. We don\u2019t adequately monitor the danger of addiction and overuse, so it slides under the radar.",
        "\"It's difficult.\"\nYes, once people have been lied to for decades, having been told ethanol is \"good for you in moderation,\" it's difficult for them to now accept that it's never good for you, no matter the amount.\nThe placement advertising by the drinks industry in Hollywood programming has been extremely successful. It's difficult to tell people to stop emulating their pop culture heroes, to stop 'being cool.'\nThe cancer warning idea doesn't go to the heart of the health issues anyway.\nThe real danger lies is the chronic inflammatory effects of ethanol and all the associated snacks consumed while imbibing.\nThe obesity epidemic in the United States and the massive increase in chronic\u2014and preventable\u2014diseases can be attributed in large part to Americans' appetite for ethanol.\nThe only way this is going to change is if Americans choose to grow up.\nIf they continue to choose immediate gratification over long-term benefit, the problem will only get worse.",
        "Thanks for helping me make sense of the advisory. I'm not much of a drinker, but now I can temper even my IPA fetish. Beer or bubbly water, I ask in the evenings. 98% of the time it's water. I'm moving that up to 99%. Great data, thank you.",
        "I\u2019m not sure when we became so indignant to information, when we began taking it as a personal affront. It\u2019s a dangerous thing though to react to science, information, knowledge with eye rolls, how dare they, and doubling down.

If we\u2019re angry about the Surgeon General\u2019s warning, maybe step back and think about why. Maybe we need something else, like to focus on our own mental health. Nobody\u2019s telling you to stop drinking. It is information to help you make decisions.\n\nEveryone has a right and duty to managing their own health. For me, as a cancer survivor at a young age, I take that duty seriously and actively look for ways to feel better and improve my odds of being around to see my children grown up.

Maybe a cancer warning on labels will be more effective, but I doubt it. The use of alcohol as a mood changer has a long, long history. And has anyone noticed that for whatever reason--probably funding from the wine industry--the drinking of wine in television dramas is ubiquitous. Almost any character you can name regularly has a glass of wine, a big glass. It will be interesting to see if that changes. (Smoking, too, seems to have made something of a comeback on television: characters have taken to sneaking a cigarette.)",
        "First of all alcohol is no different than tobacco in that it affects everyone differently. Just as some people can smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a day and live to be 100, some can drink a whole bottle of wine and not be adversely affected. Secondly, given the stress of living in these times and the fact that drugs like marijuana are illegal in most states, most who do imbibe are not about to quit.",
        "Cigarettes used to be cool, glamorous, and nearly ubiquitous in offices, planes, and restaurants.  We learned that they caused cancer and killed people and people now smoke much less.  Alcohol seems to be following the same pattern (doesn't kill others with second hand drinking, but does kill plenty of people with drunk driving and gun deaths).  Maybe \"what are you drinking?\" should be replaced by \"would you like a seltzer\" when we walk into restaurants and people's homes.",
        "This is how I feel about pot and other drugs, too. No, I\u2019m not saying alcohol should be illegal. I\u2019m saying that warnings are there to guide people and keep them in check.

        "I worry about the many cancer studies that do NOT take alcohol consumption into consideration.\n\nGood research requires us to isolate the variables.

Some of us want to be advised and guided away from harm toward healthy longevity. Others simply want to enjoy the pleasures of the short term. Many of us are a not-entirely rational mix of the two. \n\nAfter years of drinking, I've started drinking less on my own as I hit middle age, because I simply was feeling worse when I drank.
