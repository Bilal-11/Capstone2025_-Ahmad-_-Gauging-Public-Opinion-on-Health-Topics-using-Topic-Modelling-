        "Let\u2019s add basal cell cancer to the list. Mohs surgery performed by dermatologists is a cure for a cancer that is a limited cancer, if a cancer at all. Rarely it will metastasize. Mostly it recurs and needs a modest reexcision. But mohs folks get paid as surgeons and pathologists. Their \u201ccure\u201d rate is minimally better than other means of treatment but they have become the gurus of dermatology costing largely Medicare for treating a disease that is of low risk at best.",
        "Thanks for your coverage of this topic. \n\nIn 2009, at the age of 51, I received a diagnosis of LCIS. I sought a second opinion at a major cancer hospital where my \u201ccancer\u201d was more appropriately defined: stage \u201cdouble zero\u201d (not \u201ccancer\u201d, but \u201catypical cells\u201d with the POTENTIAL to become invasive). Following confirmation from an open surgical biopsy - and with no family history of cancer - I enrolled in the center\u2019s \u201chigh risk\u201d clinic as well as their research study.  After being followed every six months over a ten year period, I remain cancer free with yearly monitoring via mammograms and ultrasounds.  \n\nI am so thankful to have been an early beneficiary of this level of care.",
        "I couldn't take \"active surveillance\" as an option. I'd be terrified of my own body. Hey boobs, are you trying to kill me in between these frequent screenings or should I have just cut you off when I had the chance? The mental anguish would be more than I could bear.",
        "As a layperson, I think I would appreciate this change, at least I would have done in my situation. I had what the first doctor called \"pre-cancerous cells\" which likely needed to be removed, and referred me to the appropriate type of doctor. Ok. I was nervous, obviously, and I went. The second doctor still called the cells pre-cancerous but said they wanted to observe only by increasing the frequency of appointments. Then, I moved - and one of my major concerns was figuring out how to access a doctor to maintain the observation. Again, same type of appointment, and as the test came back not pre-cancerous? they didn't notify me the results were negative. Of course the wait worried me, so I called. And now they say, thank goodness, that the cells aren't pre-cancerous and I don't need to worry about extra appointments to keep any eye on them.\n\nSo, at this point, while I am grateful to not have to worry about that word, I will also try to continue to go to the doctor more frequently than the latest recommendation because of the mixed messages.\n\nThis wasn't even cancer and it caused a great deal of stress, across doctors and even states. The word alone scared me. Even with \"pre\" in front of it.",
        "Perhaps in the generation of \u201cCoddling of the American Mind\u201d (authors:  Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt), the suggestion of not calling cancer or a pre-cancerous lesion, the \u201cC-word\u201d, is not surprising.  However, we should not sugar coat a potentially dangerous diagnosis, so a patient feels better.  Patients should be given as much information as possible to help them make the best choice for themselves.  People who exhibit markers of pre-diabetes are warned to change diet, lose weight, etc to prevent diabetes.  A synonym for diabetes is not given to the patient so they can be assured all is fine.  It is not.  As with any precancerous lesion, something is lurking in the body that has the potential to cause some serious damage.\n\nI do agree with improving surveillance and not jumping into premature aggressive treatments.  But I disagree with avoiding the term \u201ccancer\u201d.   I bet some lawyers will absolutely agree with your suggestion, so when those patients with pre-cancerous lesions or markers ignore that they have a potentially serious condition, ultimately succumb to that condition b/c they didn\u2019t understand that they had CANCER (or a condition that could lead to cancer), lawsuits can ensue.",
        "We should do the same with psychiatric conditions. Most are variants of normality or are exacerbation of normal behavior under duress, abuse, or other forms of stress.\n\nOther than schizophrenia (psychosis really), severe forms of depression, and mental health issues that impair one's ability to reproduce, all else quite much could be considered not actual disorders.\n\n(before anyone comments, autism is in the realm of neurology, not psychiatry)",
        "Prostate and breast oncologists wrote this article, two of the most treatable and possibly slow growing malignancies a patient can have.  There is some merit but active surveillance in a healthy patient is a great way to turn them unhealthy in two years.\n\nThe concept of over treatment in early stage cancers would be better discussed by a thoracic oncologist, hepatic oncologist or any other oncology profession.  The average reader does not understand the prognostic difference of primary tumor sites.",
        "In 2009 my father was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer Gleason 9 in at age 88. He was not offered genetic testing at that time and died 9 months later. He had declined biopsy over the years though his PSA was rising steadily. He got differing opinions - watch and wait or castration before his bladder finally failed from the enlarged prostate. Men in that age group often die from something else, and he was reluctant to do biopsy. He had been recommended for aortic valve replacement at 85 which he did but lots of complications. Intervention is double edged sword, since he survived heart surgery only to suffer a lot with the prostate cancer, catheters, etc.  \n\nIn 2012 I was diagnosed with TNBC IDC IIA at age 51 and was tested for BRCA which was negative. Then 2014 BCC skin cancer, and 2017 endometrial cancer. Further genetic testing showed Lynch syndrome MSH6 (and MLH1 VUS). Neither of my parents were still alive by then, so they could not be tested.\n\nBottom line is any patient with any form of cancer - low risk or otherwise - should be offered full panel genetic testing to know their full risk profile. A tumor may appear one way and genetics play a role in how it may progress.",
        "I admire that you are both oncologists. However, I noticed that you do not cover cervical cancer caused by HPV. I believe that there are 3 types of HPV or strains that can cause cervical cancer. \nMy husband gave me the joy of HPV. I had to have a hysterectomy. I had already had my kids. You don't cover this at all in your article. You should have also put in here about young girls from 9 get the shots to prevent HPV.\nI also noticed (could not put all of this in one article) that you did not cover the increase rise in oral cancers caused by HPV. \nThis points to the fact that there is an increase in oral sex. \nBy whom you say, young teens.",
        "I received a DCIS diagnosis from the breast surgeon who performed my biopsy.  She said, \"You don't have cancer!\" and then she said \"I recommend a double mastectomy\" and proceeded to put me on the surgery schedule.  I was so confused and anxious I agreed, at least until I had time to calm down and do my homework.  After lots of reading and talking with other women with the same diagnosis I decided to have a single mastectomy - I don't have the BRCA gene and I couldn't wrap my head around removing a perfectly healthy body part just in case.  I'm happy with my decision, especially since I've had complications with the implant and now need more surgery.  One foreign object in my body is enough.",
        "Most, not some, surgeries are unnecessary and I would include back surgeries, orthoscopic surgeries, bypass surgery and joint replacements. How is that  for some heresy.",
        "My husband was diagnosed in 2009 with prostate cancer (PC), Gleason 6, after a nodule was felt during his DRE.  His PSA was less than 1.  The docs recommended treatment. \n Being anti-surgery and anti-treatment, he had 3 annual biopsies as recommended by his urologist, but then decided to just have annual PSAs done and no further biopsies unless his PSA shot up or he developed new symptoms, recommendations made by  a third urologist who himself had PC.  Of the three biopsies, the worst results were 3 of 12 positive cores, with less than 5% cancerous cells in any core.  It was those stats that made us question the necessity of the yearly biopsy, a procedure that carries its own risks.  Now at age 73 his PSA is up to 2, and his worst enemy is his arthritis.  We appreciate this article!",
        "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2015. By that time, I felt that it was not a threat and that at my age, 71, even if I developed prostate cancer it would be unlikely to kill me before I died of something else. \n\nAt my annual physical my Doctor said that my prostate felt \u201creally good\u201d but when the PSA test shot up dramatically from the previous year he referred me to a urologist. The urologist did a biopsy which was a Gleason 7. He explained many options, didn\u2019t pressure me, but was clear that the combination of Gleason score and change in PSA was significant. I opted for removal and the Gleason score after removal was 10. \n\nAfter time had passed and I should no longer have a PSA, I did. I was placed on hormone therapy and referred to a radiologist. 38 sessions of radiation therapy. Hormone therapy continued for a year. The PSA had become less than.04 or \u201cessentially undetectable\u201d. I have been monitored since and my PSA has remained there. \n\nI had a friend who was diagnosed about the same time as I was. We compared notes in December 2017. He had a Gleason 6 and was treated initially with waiting. He died of prostate cancer 2 years ago. \n\nI recognize the point that there is often over treatment but under treatment is also an issue. And under treatment can have fatal consequences. The issue is complex and a blanket policy can lead to bad outcomes. Every case has to be evaluated individually.",
        "Well, all Gleason score 3+3=6 cases are supposed to be surveilled these says. They are indolent invasive carcinomas, but can  evolve into higher grade tumours and therefore need close monitoring.  Ductal carcinoma in situ of the  breast is a non-invasive lesion sure, but even after lumpectomy (as opposed to diagnostic core biopsy)about 15 % of patients will develop recurrent invasive carcinomas over 10 years, a recurrence rate halved by radiation. At this point its very unclear which of these patients, if any, can be surveilled after diagnostic biopsy So clearly at least a subset of these need therapy . Just saying.   Also, I'm a practicing surgical pathologist, part of a group clearly not included in this article.",
        "I\u2019ll argue that we need to better educate the medical community as well as patients. Can\u2019t remember the last time that I saw a patient write orders for a medical procedure.\n\nBut we also need a lot better information. For instance, we found out that our family had a BRAC2 mutation almost by accident and a very persistent family member who thought something was \u2018off\u2019 in our mother\u2019s breast cancer. Since mother was first diagnosed with breast cancer at age 83, I found out that she NEVER would have in the genetic database..they give up on women at age 80.\n\nBased on mother\u2019s age at diagnosis, we would never have found out that we needed to be tested for the mutation.",
        "I was diagnosed with DCIS. Upon learning all I could, my inclination was to join a study, where no intervention would be taken. \n\nMy family had a fit, and I gave in. \n\nI underwent surgery and radiation.  I am also taking hormones.\n\nI wish I had stuck to my guns and not undergone treatment. \n\nI totally agree with the authors here.",
        "One thing I would consider in choosing my cancer care is the quality of my health insurance. I have good, very expensive, health insurance right now.  If I change jobs or retire I probably won't have this insurance.  I'd treat now.",
        "The decision by a patient to do or not do a  procedure to remove a low grade cancer is a very difficult decision. In the mind of the patient who takes no action, other than being followed , will still be thinking \"is this spreading\". Every trip to the doctor is wrought with fear \"has it spread\". A person with low grade prostate cancer and is young, under 50, and Gleason of 6 could be told that you can wait and see. But he will also be told that if  it spreads beyond the prostate  at which point his chance of cure is significantly reduced. The same goes for breast cancer.Both are very difficult decisions for the patient to make.  I won't get into the issue of misdiagnosed more aggressive cancers that could have been treated but were described as low grade. Using the word \"cancer\" should not be avoided. It is what it is. And it should prompt action. Using other names to describe the same condition merely puts the patient wrongfully at ease.",
        "This is such a vital proposal - and I'm writing this after years of stressful PSA tracking and fusion biopsies of my prostate and after having a thyroid *cancer* diagnosis and half my thyroid removed in 2021, followed by daily doses of Levothyroxine for the rest of my life. After that procedure, my friend David Ropeik, a longtime risk-communication professional who's written a forthcoming book called \"Cancerphobia,\" sent me the thyroid chapter, which convinced me I could and probably should have chosen watchful waiting. Thanks for publishing the piece.",
        "One step we could all take to reduce our risk of cancer in the first place is to eat whole plant foods, avoiding processed foods and eating little to no animal products. Instead, eat veggies and fruit, legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils, and split peas) and whole grains (not processed into refined flour), and in small amounts nuts and seeds. Avoid added oils and sugar, too.\n\nI learned this too late in my life, after I was diagnosed with breast cancer and my husband with prostate cancer. But as soon as we did learn this, we started eating whole plant foods to reduce our risk of a recurrence. We also exercise moderately, and avoid alcohol and tobacco. And we feel better and lost weight, too.",
        "\"Preneoplasia\" as a preferred term is window-dressing.  I have a family history positively brimming with neoplasia of the bladder, breast, uterus, fallopian tubes, and lymph nodes.   Depending on the individual, these were repeated, concurrent, or sequential. I buried all of them in the last decade.  It's still cancer.  So if I read \"preneoplasia\" in my chart, I'm not fooled about what it means.  Actions are more important - screening, diagnoses, communication, treatment options, and - almost above everything else - comprehensive and equitable insurance coverage.",
        "\"Ask anyone who has been told this: It\u2019s terrifying.\"\n\nIn 2010, the results of my biopsy came in -- prostate cancer. My father had died of prostate cancer, but the announcement was not one I found remotely terrifying. After living a life I hoped would serve me well in old age, I discovered that genes can defeat years of eating right, exercise, and avoidance of stress. My response to the prostate cancer diagnosis had more to do with \"so what else is new\" than terror. My Gleason score was seven (the better seven -- 3 + 4).\n\nAdmittedly, prostate cancer is not the same as a diagnosis of lung cancer (I never smoked) or pancreatic cancer, but it still kills quite a few, mostly elderly men. My father was only 66 when he died. I was 63 when diagnosed.\n\nI went to the University of Washington Medical Center (then part of the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance) and on the same day met separately with the head of the Urology Department, another urologist, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist. Then, all five of us met together to decide on treatment. For a variety of reasons I chose brachytherapy. Thirteen years later my PSA is still undetectable. \n\nGiven all the other health problems I have experienced, I can honestly say, cancer was not even close to the worst. I realize that my situation is not generalizable. Others face much more daunting diagnoses. My point is that while cancer is never welcomed, neither is it always the worst thing that can happen to a person. Don't despair.",
        "\"Some doctors who disagree with us argue that early-stage cancer patients may have regions of their prostate or breast with unsampled, riskier cancers that may pose a threat and should be treated accordingly.\" I would like to remind those doctors that the same applies to the seemingly healthy general population. Just like they don't assume that healthy people have cancer, it doesn't make sense to assume that people with early-stage cancer could also have riskier cancers. This is something that should be studied and proved statistically before these more aggressive treatments are prescribed in these situations.",
        "Four years before I was diagnosed with DCIS in my early 50s, my mother had died of metastasized breast cancer. After my diagnosis, my doctor did a wonderful job of explaining it to me just as you have done in this article. However, with my children in elementary and middle school, I opted for a lumpectomy instead of active surveillance. (I did not get radiation or tamoxifen afterwards, as no one saw a need.) Had I been older, and with older children, I would have been comfortable with active surveillance of my DCIS; not only would I have avoided surgery, but I could have helped advance medical science in some small way, with little risk to me. I agree that these diagnoses need individualized treatment options.",
        "Doctors are subjective, fallible humans. Some are up-to-date with the latest science; others aren't. Some, for whatever reason, always advocate a more aggressive approach; others don't. Until there is a truly objective way to assess risk/predict the future, opting for treatment will always be a personal choice based on limited, biased information. The best we can hope for is continued scientific advancement and access to large amounts of data and multiple knowledgeable physicians who can provide their opinions.",
        "The vast majority of clinicians involved in the treatment of the two cancers described by Drs. Esserman and Eggener already recommend individualized - and sometimes quite limited - treatment plans for these patients. Renaming these neoplasms will not meaningfully change standard treatment, and may lull patients generally into a mistaken belief that carcinomas of the breast or prostate are less serious than they really are.",
        "The article presents valid alternatives for diagnosing and treating cancers. But the article does not address health insurance realities. If we don't call it cancer, watchful waiting and all the testing that should accompany watchful waiting may not be covered by insurance. And I am not reassured that watchful waiting is a real option given how hard it is to get doctors' visits and tests. Frequent watchful waiting tests may be more stressful than actual surgery, if the cancer can be totally removed. Plus the world's experts (the authors) may not recognize the danger from lesser experts and limited followup testing.",
        "I was diagnosed with DCIS three years ago when a biopsy revealed stage 0, grade 2 (intermediate risk) cells. I enrolled n the COMET study comparing surgery to active surveillance, and was placed in the surgery arm. Surgery revealed grade 3 (high risk) cells, but no lymph node involvement. I'm in my 50's with grown children, but younger women especially do not want to take the risk of a low-grade cancer turning into a higher-grade tumor that is extremely unpleasant to treat and interferes with their family life. They'd rather take preventative measures like prophylactic surgery. Until there is a foolproof way to predict what DCIS cells are going to grow and which aren't, that's a reasonable choice.",
        "I am 72 and have mostly given up on all the screenings we are supposed to get, mostly because I dislike living in fear of what I might come down with. The medical industry is partly responsible for this fear when they oversell the risks as described in this article. But it also goes hand-in-hand with the evolution of medicine into an industry that wants to hover over us, excessively, in my view.",
        "I'm all for not calling something cancer, when it isn't a cancer.  But it isn't clear to me from this article at all that what is being advocated here makes sense.  The writers believe that patients are being given treatment (or surgeries) that are unnecessary, but what exactly does unnecessary mean in this context, because except for early prostate cancer statistics, I don't see any other statistics in here.  In other words, yes, a woman with DCIS doesn't need a mastectomy to survive with DCIS.  But the REAL question is whether it will progress to something with a worse prognosis--and it doesn't sound like we know whether it will, but the risks are heightened.  In that instance, it would be perfectly reasonable for a woman to say \"I'll just get a mastectomy now and not have to worry about it in the future\".  Because it isn't clear what the alternative is - wait and see ...see what?  Wait until it's actually turned \"into\" cancer (per these writers), when your prognosis is now worse?  To me, the question is whether the offered treatment actually is successful and success means different things - for late stage cancer it can either mean becoming free from cancer or extending life for some time.  For this early stage [non]cancer, it might mean significantly lowering the risk of progression to a worse stage--why wouldn't that be a worthy goal if we can't offer patients any certainty about saving them if they only continue to monitor and it DOES turn into a malignancy?",

        "Dr. Laszlo Tabar, a world-renown breast imaging radiologist from Sweden and the main researcher in the largest randomly controlled trial proving the usefulness of screening mammography, has a new classification of breast cancers based on the imaging bio markers which indicate cellular origin more accurately.  \n\nHis research proves that we misclassify breast cancers causing under- and over-treatment.  TRUE DCIS is, in actuality, a duct-forming, invasive cancer which can kill.  Much of what is called \u2018DCIS\u2019 doesn\u2019t originate in the ducts at all.  This adds to the confusion, mis-treatment and, ultimately distrust of the entire system.\n\nUntil US pathologists adopt large section slides in order to see the true cellular origins of breast cancers, we will continue to under-treat some, over-treat others and, ultimately fail to save the lives of too many women. \n\nJerome S.

So another friend with stage 2 - had a lumpectomy, the tumor removed with clean margins, radiation, chemo and 5 years of the most aggressive drug on the market at the time usually given to Stage 4 and beyond, but her excellent doc threw everything at a breast cancer diagnosis in those days.

Some commenters seem to suggest that this is some sort of insurance company conspiracy to reduce costs, but I don't think that's true.

I had my whole thyroid removed because it was what was suggested/what the pros and cons were that I weighed at the time; genetic testing etc. Fast forward to three years later, I find a new doctor who is amazing. We were having an in depth conversation about my health and she reluctantly told me she probably would have had me wait, if I had been her patient, to remove the thyroid. She said she probably would have waited and used surveillance at first considering most thyroid cancers are so slow moving.

Two psychologists interviewed many radiologists to find out what is the criteria for determining cancer and then built a model around that. They then gave the same stack of scans to several doctors and often the doctors contradicted each others diagnosis. To test it further they put in the same scan of the same person multiple times in the stack and often the same doctor in one scan would say it was in cancer while it was not the next time they saw the same scan.

No hesitation: Yank it.  So he did.  Are there side effects?  Yes, but he isn't worried that he's going to die from advanced prostate cancer.

ADT shuts off testosterone, the primary fuel for metastatic prostate cancer, like a cheap $1:49 wall switch.  ADT has plenty of side effects, including a passion for the Hallmark Channel, but I have been able to approach 80 now free of those  effects for more than 9 of the last 11 years or so.  Obviously cases are individual.  But I am very grateful to be treated by an Oncologist who has always strived to achieve a balance in his treatment decisions.",

In 2018 after another jump in my PSA, I had another another biopsy. This time, a small amount of microscopic (detectable only under a microscope) Gleason 6 prostate cancer was found. No surprise. If they keep hunting for prostate cancer as you age, sooner or later they will find some.\n\nThe local urologist here in FL urged me to have radiation ASAP.

Long story short, I have been on active surveillance for six years, which means a PSA check every six months and a yearly MRI to confirm nothing has changed.  \n\nAny man diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer should  have his slides examined by a second pathologist to confirm that he doesn't have a cancer higher than Gleason 6, and then consult the most experienced docs he can find, even if that means traveling to a \"center of excellence\" hospital, to understand his options.

        "I was aggressively treated for an ovarian cancer identified in stage 1A.  The type typically does not migrate and stays contained.  You see, not all ovarian cancers are the same.  However, my doctor had to take samples of all of abdominal lymph nodes, removing about 24 lymph nodes, to the point that I needed to have followup watch for lymphedema in my legs.  Of course, a full hysterectomy as well.  All of the samples were negative, and then they recommended chemo, and I said no way.  I did my research - in Europe, they don't do chemo for this type of cancer.  I felt massively overtreated.  I've had numbness in my right thigh (likely a nerve damaged in surgery), problems with incontinence, achy legs (from lymph drainage issues?).

The patient then (rightly) says to the doctor \"what's this - I have a tumor that spread? Then I have cancer, right?

Eventually she ended up with a ductal carcinoma biopsy. I believe the stress and constant damage to her breast tissue correlates with this outcome.\n\nEven if the names are changed and active surveillance becomes the norm, the stress that comes with active surveillance still needs to be addressed in the community. Living on pins and needles while waiting for the next scan to be clear or suspect, is no way to live.

I don't run with scissors.\n\nMDS has fairly recently been classified as a cancer.  \n\nFor two years now we have tried seven different treatments to raise my platelet count.  The only one that worked for a while was Nplates, but they too now are failing to help, so we have discontinued that treatment too.\n\nThe next step is chemo.  I had seen my father suffer badly through chemo for his prostate cancer.

        "In regards to prostate cancer, the author points out that men with Gleason scores of 6 should undergo surveillance and not be treated.  Under the AMA task force guidelines it is suggested that men over 70 stop taking the PSA prostate cancer test.  I am a healthy 76 year old and luckily my primary care physician gave me the PSA test.  Ultimately I was found to have a Gleason score of 7, the more aggressive 7.  I ended up having focal radiation treatment which has a 90% chance of killing the cancer and of it not returning.  When I asked my radiologist about the task force's guidelines, he said there is a chance that I will treat you for this cancer and at 76 you will die of something else in a year.

But in a biopsy diagnosis of Gleason 6 you can not know whether something more sinister is lurking there and definitely men with Gleason 6 in their biopsy have died from the disease due to undersampling.  It is also possible and likely that over time some  untreated Gleason 6 cancers progress and become more aggressive.",

It made me feel like I couldn\u2019t reach out to others who had had breast cancer to be part of a larger group. Additionally, I had no children and tamoxifen forced me to postpone this part of my life. I felt like if the standard of care for this treatment was so invasive I at least deserved to have a diagnosis worthy of respect, of fitting in. I understand that it was a noninvasive lesion, but the treatment was the same as if it were a carcinoma. Now, 13 years later I have an invasive carcinoma in that same breast and I have mentors and groups to be a part of.

A doctor who did that might be held legally responsible for failure to sufficiently alert the patient to possible dangers.\n\n2- Follow-up care:  A patient who was informed that their condition was NOT cancer might be less inclined to follow a strict regimen of follow-up care than one who believed they did have \"cancer\" but at a very early stage that might never progress. \n\n3- Financial: Sadly, not all physicians are motivated by the most noble intentions................which explains why there is so much unnecessary surgery performed in this country.\n\nPerhaps the bottom line is that each patient (and their condition) needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis and all should participate, where possible, in the final treatment decisions.",

I began my own research and found an article in the Journal of Pancreatic Cancer that CBD can increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy.  I also found similar articles elsewhere about positive results using Tadalafil (Cialis), Fenugreek Seed, and Turmeric.\n\nSo I started using this combination, taking them every night plus larger doses an hour or so before treatments, which included radiation.

They could have seeded other body parts long before detection, or never. But early detection is critical to informed decision making. I worry that this article will discourage people from screening exams.\n\n- There are many new initiatives to detect and treat very early stage problems without invasive strategies. And there are new techniques for monitoring (blood tests for cell free  circulating tumor DNA, etc) and research into who is likely to have later problems.\n\n- Two months before diagnosis of stage four cancer, I was pronounced in perfect health by my internist.

There was a great deal of pressure brought to bear 6 years ago to have a complete hysterectomy to prevent this from becoming uterine cancer.\nI agree that uterine cancer-any kind of pelvic cavity cancer -including colon cancer-that gets away and metasticizes is quite grim. \nBut I did not have cancer. The doctor explained that the condition doubles my risk. I did some research that indicated that the lifelong risk of uterine cancer for women is about 4%. My condition then doubles it to 8%. I saw that I had a more than 90% chance that I would not get uterine cancer.I decided to take my chances.\nA hysterectomy comes with a lot of consequences: increased risk of cardiac disease, loss of core strength, leading to bad posture and perhaps worse back problems. I already have back problems. Dry eyes are almost universally a consequence and I am told that people who do not have them do not understand what a horrible quality of life issue they can be. There is possible bladder prolapse and in many cases serious sexual compromises lay in wait. I decided that I did not want a preventive hysterectomy.I respect my doctor's perspective who has seen people die of uterine cancer. But I am glad that I could decide for myself.\nWorthwhile article.",

        "As a recently retired family physician, I have some thoughts about this:\n1. Thank you to the authors for broaching this topic. No, DCIS is NOT breast cancer requiring mastectomy. And every uptick in the PSA doesn't require multi quadrant biopsies. The approach has to be more measured and collaborative between patients and their physicians.\n2. And why aren't there better studies to come up with evidence-based protocols for follow-up and shared decision making? There's simply no money in it--at least not like there is in pharmaceuticals and surgical technology.\n3. Finally, the authors fail to address the ultimate drivers of this over-diagnosis and over-treatment: misaligned health system incentives. Fee-for-service healthcare and piecework compensation for procedures--often reimbursed at far higher rates than the compensation for communicating and collaborating with patients---will inevitably result in this state of affairs. Just look at the pay differential between primary care doctors and procedure driven subspecialties. \nAs George Bernard Shaw once said, \"Why would you give someone a pecuniary interest in taking off your leg?\"",
        "Really appreciate this article. The life insurance industry should take note. I can imagine someone like me, having recently been diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer, being rejected for coverage because they had to answer \"yes\" on the cancer question, as opposed more accurately checking an IDLE box (\"For men, have you been diagnosed with an indolent lesion of epithelial origin in your prostate?\"). By following my urologist's advice after my PSA test and going on to get an MRI and biopsy, I've possibly made myself uninsurable even though research suggests that I am no higher of a risk than another man who hasn't had their PSA tested or undergone an MRI and biopsy. In fact, by eliminating the possibility that I am carrying a more serious illness in my prostate, all other things being equal it's not unreasonable to consider me a *better* risk than someone who's never had any of those tests done and is walking around with a mystery bag for a prostate.",

Doctors have been urging and even brow-beating women with breast cancer into excessive treatment for decades.  \n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in 2011, I read the American and the European guides for treatment. In the US, chemo was recommended for far earlier stages of breast cancer, (Stage 1) than in Europe. One can't help but wonder if more aggressive action is taken in the US because the state is not paying for it, and because profits and income in the US are increased when more is done, not just for doctors, but also for drug companies, medical device manufacturers, etc, etc.\n\nResearch has now shown that around 70% of women don't benefit from chemo: they live with considerable side effects for no benefit. \n\nMost women won't try to say \"no\" to recommended treatments, but for those of us who do, the pressure is immense, from family, friends, and also doctors. One radiologist pretty much trapped you in his office with a 1+ hour harangue. It would not be an exaggeration to say that some of these meetings were \ntraumatizing.

You mentioned two very common neoplasms, undeserving of radical surgery; personally, I stopped having the prostatic antigen test long ago (now, 82 yo), as its rationale escapes me (of note, as a retired GS); and can relate to a more 'benign' approach to cancer in-situ (you mentioned breas and cervix). A relative of mine had a sizable inflammatory breast carcinoma, and treated successfully with chemotherapy (with persistent annoying side effects elsewhere), followed by radiotherapy, with disappearance of the tumor; hence, forgoing a mastectomy. A day may come when a simple blood test may alert us as to the existence of a neoplasm in our body; this, as I'm told we do have cancer cells developing in our body sometimes, of which we shall remain unaware...and eventually die of some unrelated issues.The name of the game ought to be taking preventive measures, such as a proper diet, enough exercise, enough rest, avoid alcoholism and smoking, and some other abuses to our pretty but fragile self. And further, altering our DNA and useful drugs for control. Lets exercise humility for the little we know!",

        "While I think there is some wisdom in this approach, at least some of the time, there are some issues with it too. Not every finding is black and white when it comes to the degree of risk. And not every doctor is equally skilled at predicting what will happen next - and none of them know with certainty.\n\nI did not freak out when I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Since no one could even feel a lump, I assumed correctly that my tumor was quite small. But when considering treatments, that wasn't totally reassuring. My ductal carcinoma was labeled \"invasive\", the type of cancer was triple negative (considered the most aggressive and hardest to treat), my grading on the Nottingham was 2 (intermediate - cells quite abnormal but growth rate slow). So with this mixture of high and low risk, it becomes a matter of judgment what to do next. \n\nIf a doctor had decided to call it something other than cancer, what would that have accomplished? Well, it would have kept me from from learning the things I need to know to help me participate in making decisions. While I shouldn't have the authority to decide independently, \"I want chemo!!!\", neither should I be left totally in the dark, putting all my trust in the doctor's decision. If I happened to have a doctor whose knowledge was not top-notch, I wouldn't even know to ask for a second opinion.\n\nUsing staging and defining clearly what that means helps a lot of people.",

It's a nice idea but a mistake. I had adenocarcinoma at the tip of a pedunculated polyp removed at colonoscopy. At the subsequent meeting with the surgeon I had the opportunity to choose a partial colectomy. As a physician myself, I was surprised at this. The surgeon said, \"Well, some patients hear the word 'cancer' and want everything done.\" Although it sounds very 1950s, giving the patient a certain amount of the decision making is not always a good thing. By having a CEA and CT I avoided all the risks of laparotomy, general anesthesia, and partial colectomy.",

The diagnosis of Keratoacanthoma is a good example of a 'cancer' that has low probability of being aggressive, but the pathology report usually says the 'possibility of Squamous Cell Carcinoma cannot be ruled out'.

        "Having been diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 69 (in 2017), both my wife and I were quite concerned as my urologist wanted to remove it immediately or have me go through radiation. Further personal research introduced me to Dr. Klotz of Toronto University, Canada who had coined the phrase Active Surveillance. As stated in the essay, Gleason 6 is the \"Tipping Point\" for considering treatment. I was diagnosed with Gleason 8 (Grade Group 4) although I was first told Gleason 7 (3 + 4) or Grade 2.\n\nI chose to research other modalities of control (I believe we never fully remove the cancer - only control it). Currently I am on ADT (Androgen Deprivation Therapy) which shrinks the prostate and hampers this cancer growth. Combining this with a change in diet (no red meat or preserved meats, lowered dairy and high cholesterol foods) with increased tomatoes, red and purple vege's, fruits and crucifers (cabbage family) has reduced my PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) numbers to less than 2. I am now on an altered Active Surveillance but watch for PSA 6 as a number of concern. The side effects of the ADT can be handled readily by a change in life-style.\n\nI have also joined an online group \"The Reluctant Brotherhood\" of prostate cancer survivors which, for any interested can be found through Facebook.

And that if a man lives to be old enough he will invariably get at least some cancer in the prostate, but it won't cause any trouble. \n\nSo then I played the odds.  It looked like odds of early detecting the possible cancer , and then the odds of the intervention that could occur after being detected being of any benefit , were low.  But the costs of doing early detecting were quite high.  I have health insurance so not that cost, just all the 'costs' of any medical test.  And then the cost , to my serenity, if the cancer were detected but I decided that it was better not to do anything.  Basically I would rather not know.  So I decided that the risk of the cancer killing me because I didn't detect, and intervene surgically etc. , was low enough that avoiding the definite cost of detecting, and the cost of knowing but taking no action, outweighed that risk.\nSo far so good.",

        "Many of the comments reinforce the authors' point that to the lay person, cancer is cancer, it's scary, and aggressive treatment is required.  In the case of breast DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), what the pathologist sees under the microscope are cells that show the abnormalities of cancer cells but they are confined within the ducts in the breast, i.e., are still in place and have not invaded, and invasion is necessary to meet the full definition of cancer.  \n\nWith DCIS, additional tests are done to the biopsy to further characterize the cells, and as the authors state, \"For DCIS, a majority of hormone-positive patients \u2014 in which cancer cells contain certain proteins that can be targeted to reduce the chance of cancer arising \u2014 may be suitable for active surveillance with therapies to slow or stop the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors, but we won\u2019t know until we study it.\" In layman's terms, this means that there are drugs that can block the effects of estrogen on the non-invasive \"cancerous\" cells inhibiting their growth. So for hormone positive DCIS, it may be a sufficient treatment to use these drugs instead of surgery or radiation to prevent spread.  The authors are proposing to change the name of DCIS to a less triggering name to make such less aggressive treatments acceptable when they are shown to be effective.",
        "This article gives me the willies.  Not everyone has timely access to physicians like the specialists who wrote this article, and our current health care system does not facilitate or support a watchful waiting period. Even when a serious condition is suspected, it takes months to get an appointment with a doctor with whom you have an existing relationship much less a specialist, most physicians have sold their private practices to hospital systems due to differences in reimbursement rates for the same procedures performed by doctors' offices as opposed to hospitals, doctors are monitored by algorithms that penalize them financially for more than average  patient referrals for expensive tests and only 15 -20 minutes is allotted for an office visit.  Internal medicine and family practice physicians are in short supply, with NPs with only a fraction of a doctor's clinical training providing the lion's share of the medical care.  Is it reasonable to expect that a significant change in an early stage cancer will be timely caught under these circumstances?  The reality is that DCIS (and other early stage cancers) can very quickly morph into an aggressive, life-threatening cancerous condition depending on the genetic and other forces at work. There is also no discussion of the role that genetic testing plays in all of this.  Have the BRACA gene?  No point in waiting for what will inevitably be a death sentence.",
        "My initial diagnosis was DCIS. Five months later I had a mastectomy and the pathology reveled pervasive adenocystic cancer throughout my breast. Seven years later I wonder if I would be enjoying my life if the treatment had been less aggressive. I understand not wanting to subject patients to unnecessary treatments, but how do we ensure that patients are not under treated?",
        "I think a major point that comes through in many of the comments is a lack of understanding that a cancer diagnosis  needs to be taken in the context of what kind of cancer a patient has.  Basal cell carcinoma of the skin is not the same as melanoma, which is not the same as breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, etc, which all have different subtypes, criteria for evaluating potential aggressive behavior, etc.   Additionally, cancers are typically diagnosed by a biopsy, which is only a sample of a whole.   This explains why someone with a biopsy diagnosis of a Gleason grade 3+3 on biopsy may have a 7 or 8 once a prostatectomy is done.  Similarly, not all DCIS is created equal.  A high grade DCIS has a high likelihood of harboring an invasive component once resected, a low grade DCIS, not so much.  The bottom line is that, yes, cancer is a scary word but all cancer is not created equal, and not all cancers occurring in the same location i.e breast cancer are the same.   Optimally, the biopsy results should be evaluated in the context of all aspects of the disease presentation, clinical stage, potential for aggressive behavior, etc.    Just because your neighbor had a cancer with one outcome doesn't mean you or your loved one will have the same result.  All information and evidence based treatment guidelines need to be taken into account.  This is more of an information issue than a nomenclature issue.",

Case in point, my Gleason score reached 7 (3+4) when it was advised I have a RP.  Unfortunately, despite my mandating aggressive non-nerve sparing surgery, my RP was not curative, as a trace amount of PCa had 'escaped' excision.  Based upon my postoperative PSA results, we were able to determine my PCa doubling time and I mandated we follow the recently completed RTOG 9601 clinical trial for PCa.  This required initiating pelvic salvage radiation, an aggressive treatment with the potential for serious side effects (LT GI and GU radiation toxicity).  My radiation oncologist was disinclined to initiate SRT and I had to 'argue' my case to receive treatment.  The odds my PCa was confined to the prostate fossa were low (20%), but at age 57, I was much too young to surrender to PCa.  Miracle of miracles, today marks my 5th year anniversary of progression free survival.

At 55, I limit myself to going every every 3 to 5 years for mammograms, pap smears, and Cologuard, since there are no major risk factors in my family for any of these areas. Skin checks?

Meanwhile, I just got a diagnosis of osteoporosis at age 61 after I requested the test which is normally given at age 65. Why aren't we screen for osteoporosis at age 50 and catching it early so women have more time to take action and build bone BEFORE menopause?",

Someone adopting the practices outlined in this fine opinion piece saved me from the agonies of chemo which another doctor had suggested, and with the now appropriate treatment, I'm fine.  \"Cancer\" is one of the biggest money-makers for the medical-industrial complex, and that is one of the principal reasons the diagnosis gets flung around, sometimes, and sadly, almost casually.",

        "In early 2001 I was diagnosed with prostate cancer after a biopsy showed positive. It was not an immediately dangerous condition, I was told, and it was I who decided to have it treated by external radiation. Why? Because on the paternal side of my family, my grandfather, father, my one uncle, and three aunts had all died of cancer since the early 1960s. Since then, three of the four cousins I am in touch with from that side of my family have also come down with cancer and two of those three have died of it.  Counting myself, that's 10 out of 11 family members who have had it, and 9 of them died of it! This must be some kind of record, I would think, but I'm not sure. (And one of my aunts who died traced the situation far enough back to learn that her grandmother (my great-grandmother) had died of breast cancer in 1900. So, I had the external radiation (40 2-minute treatments over the course of 8 weeks), had no problems with the treatment, no after-effects, and 22 years later am still going strong, with a PSA reading of at most 0.1. Maybe I was wrong to have the treatment, I don't know, but I'm very glad I did, and right now, at an advanced age, am as healthy as a horse, as is my sole remaining cousin, who beat breast cancer and is a year older than I am. (Interestingly, I know of not even a single case of cancer in my similarly large family from the maternal side of my personal ledger!)",

My immediate reaction was What do we do know? I got an answer, did what was advised and available. The cancer is gone and I'm finishing chemo which I undertook just in case.

At the time, my PSA was below one, for what it's worth.  The biopsy consisting of 16 needles found a very small amount of Gleason 3 cells in less than one millimeter of one biopsy needle.   Just the same, this urologist told me that I would die without immediate surgery.  No other physician has found the nodule that resulted in my first biopsy. \n\nFortunately, the New York Times was beginning a series on over treatment of  prostate cancer and I began researching the topic.  I refused prostatectomy and began searching for a urologist who would pursue a watchful waiting strategy.  None could be found.  I was yelled at, called  a fool and even walked out on because of my cautious refusal of radical treatment.\n\nAt the time, a large volume of research told me that my cancer deserved a slow and cautious response, but I was in a different world upon entering a urologist's office where invasive intervention was required.\n\nDespite all of the trouble that my poor old prostate has caused, I'm still happy to have it.",

The article\u2019s authors say that a majority of DCIS patients may be suitable for active surveillance, but we won\u2019t know until we study the disease more.

And we should not forget the thing about denial not being just a river in Egypt. People have a tendency to avoid recognition of a condition if they can. It's all very well to downplay the diagnosis of early stage cancers. But in bladder cancer, for example, leaving a non-wall penetrating growth without treatment is taking the risk that it develops into one that penetrates the lining of the bladder, a much more serious condition. Calling a condition \"pre-cancerous\" is more likely to concentrate the mind than to talk about a condition which with the passage of time could become cancer.",

He died six months after his initial diagnosis.\nThe mistake made by the authors (and many other physicians) is one of \"complete knowledge.\" This is where physicians believe they know all that's relevant to a patient's case and proceed accordingly. Oncology, while vastly improved over what it was even 20 years ago, is still very much in its infancy, with many factors (and co-factors) remaining to be discovered. \nIf my father had undergone aggressive treatment soon after his initial diagnosis, he's likely to have lived another five years or more.",

While change in how disease is described and the subsequent decisions on treatment is long overdue, I worry about this leading to denial of coverage by insurance companies based on demographics (in which there are often racial and other biases).

At a basic level, the diagnosis of cancer requires demonstration of tissue invasion, in which case metastasis becomes possible. However, the same histologic changes can occur prior to invasion; often when a biopsy shows non-invasive cancer, invasive cancer is found in more complete excisions. So there is a risk in under-treating non-invasive cancer. If the patient wishes to accept this risk (such as reasonably in  an elderly patient with limited life span), all well and good. But in today's medico-legal climate is unfair to ask the doctor to shoulder the risk entirely.",

The mass was tiny and in a localized mammary duct. Why would I need radiation if the mass was removed  and it was localized?

In the first instance, my melanoma had already metastasized.  Had I stopped after wide local excision, I would have died.  I was young.  Back then, it was new for a young person to have melanoma.  Because I moved to a NCI (National Cancer Institute) designated facility, I lived.  My second cancer is rare and, often, patients are told to monitor because physicians are not up to date.  We learn more from ongoing research.  I have neuroendocrine neoplasm with liver mets and carcinoid syndrome.  It was once assumed that people \u201cdied with, not of\u201d carcinoid.  We know better now but too many people died because physicians didn\u2019t know that carcinoid (cancer like) is not an accurate name.  The idea of identifying cancer early, potentially as pre-cancer, is to remove it before it\u2019s impossible, or even just more difficult, to remove.  My first cancer battle took 18 mos.  My current battle is ongoing, at nearly six years.  My cancers are not mentioned in the article.  If you are diagnosed, get to a NCI facility.  Always, get a second opinion!

Aggressive radiation and hormone suppression therapy and/or surgery all have predictable and too often chronic side effects from loss of bladder control to impotence to chronic urinary tract infections.  I was furious at my father's doctor for pushing radiation and hormone suppression therapy on an 88 year old man based entirely on a PSA and vague biopsy showing \"changes\".  It is being observed that hormone suppression therapy in older adults seems to cause dementia-like symptoms of memory decline with some regaining cognitive health once treatment is stopped and others not.  It is younger patients <65 who are more likely to have an aggressive form of prostate cancer while those over>70 do not.  >70 years of age, 2 of 3 men biopsied will show cell changes that are \"possibly cancer\".

        "Thank you.\nFive or six years ago I had a mammogram.  I was told it was suspicious and I needed a diagnostic mammogram.  The diagnostic was also suspicious.  The radiologist recommended a biopsy.  I had read a lot about DCIS and how at my age (77) a mammogram is not even necessary.  I read DCIS doesn't spread, and I was more likely to die from something else.  And that some doctors did not even consider DCIS a cancer.  I declined the biopsy and the radiologist was so concerned she wanted to hug me and she started to cry.  Six months later I had another diagnostic because I was concerned.  No growth.  Still recommend biopsy.  I forgot it until last year when my insurance company would pay me $50 for another one.  Different radiologist.  Benign calcifications.  Return to routine mammograms; no more diagnostic mammograms necessary.\nAt 83, I will probably decline any further mammograms.  Am really happy I stuck with my feelings and declined the biopsy.  I tell my friends about my experience.  They still get routine mammograms.\nSaved the taxpayers some money.",

        "My hope is that we can start accurately identifying cancers, pre-cancerous, and benign. As someone who had suspected advanced thyroid cancer based on someone reading an ultrasound yet having a long history of unchanged dead center normal thyroid blood tests, this cost me about $4000 and my job. It also took 6 months to get an emergency appointment. Biopsies showed nothing abnormal. I am now stuck in this protocol for another 4 years of scans costing $500 every 6 months and $300 appointments to hear nothing has changed. And then there are the days missed at work. Another person read an abdominal scan and determined I had stage 4 kidney cancer. At least this specialist determined that this just was not true. But here too it was a 5 month wait and over $6000 in scans. My ACA insurance didn't cover any of these cancer scares because the needed equipment and specialists were not in the county that I lived in thus were out of network.\n\nOur system is broken beyond repair. And while watching is nice, here too there is room for improvement. The thought that I am taking an appointment away from someone with a possible cancer weighs heavy on my soul.",
        "This is such an important article.  My mom was diagnosed with DCIS many years ago, and subjected to invasive therapies.  Surgery, lots of radiation, etc.  The stress was intense.  Flash forward a few years, and she was told that her DCIS diagnosis really shouldn't have been treated so aggressively.  A few years later she was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and was told that her past smoking plus all the radiation from the DCIS \"treatment\" may have been part of the cause.  We will never know, but the reclassification of DCIS would be helpful for so, so, many.  Thank you for this article.",
        "I don't get it.\n\nAssuming someone is intelligent enough to read this article, they should be intelligent enough to research their own medical condition, right?  So, if the normal designation of a full-fledged, developed cancer is used to describe a condition with huge potential to grow to a full-fledged cancer diagnosis, why would they not know this from their own review - and, discussion with their doctor?",
        "Mortality from prostate cancer was on the decline UNTIL the USPTF recommended against PSA screening. Since then, while mortality from other cancers has continued to decline, mortality from prostate cancer has flatlined. And more men are being diagnosed with advanced disease.

That's a much more responsible approach than \"renaming\" cancers.",

        "This is one more example of how those of us the world of medicine have done a poor job of giving names to conditions which concern us. This causes patients a lot of unnecessary worry, & influences people to make decisions which they might not make if we gave their condition a less perjorative name. \n\n Perhaps the most common example of this is the term\"pre-diabetes.\" When applied to someone who has a fasting blood sugar of 100-120, it suggests that such a person is very likely to become a full-blown diabetic very soon unless they make drastic changes in their lifestyle. But this is quite misleading. They may be at increased risk for diabetes compared to the public at large, but they have a very good chance of never becoming diabetic unless other risk factors (e.g, obesity) are present. \n\n Because the wored \"cancer\" is widely associated with a fatal prognosis, it is important to not use this term for people with a mild disorder (e.g., ductal carcinoma in situ) whose prognosis for long-term survival is excellent. When making rounds on an oncology floor, I would always use the term \"Mitotic disorder\" if a physician colleague asked me about something while we were at the patient's bedside. Similarly, using the nterm \"disorder of cell division\" is both technically accurate & less likely to cause someone to panic unnecessarily.",
        "My father had lung cancer, underwent chemo & radiation, and was more-or-less fine for about 6 years (remission or just not active disease?). Then he was diagnosedwith prostate cancer. His doctor told him that he was more likely to die from something else (he was 84 at the time) and did not recommend treatment. My dad, however, wanted treatment, so started radiation. Within a couple months, the lung cancer came roaring back to life and he was dead 6 months later. We all wondered if the stress of the new treatment gave the lung cancer the opening it needed to come back to life. Had he opted for active surveillance, perhaps he would have made 90?

Each cell type and organ differs dramatically from others. \u201cWar on cancer\u201d and \u201cCancer moon shot\u201d make for great fund-raising marketing, but we physicians know that pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, glioblastoma, and myeloma are six separate conditions.",
        "Not all doctors are greedy. I was diagnosed this summer with Gleason 6 cancer in two spots on my prostate. Dr. Eggner wrote a similar piece a couple years. This year,  my urologist said I was a very good case for active surveillance. I'm going back for a PSA in January. Probably a biopsy every couple of years. As long as it says Adenocarcinoma on my biopsy, I consider it cancer. Maybe it is time to change the name.",

        "the problem is that doctors/researchers still don't know for certain which cancers will move aggressively.  they know the odds, but not the certainties.  for example, there are women diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer that can move aggressively even though the odds are against it.  however, if yo are the one with this aggressive stage one breast cancer, the odds don't really matter.  the doctors should focus on improving their knowledge of these tumors before getting out in front of their skis",
        "I question the author\u2019s statement about the profession \u201croutinely\u201d treating Gleason 6 prostate cancer.

        "First mammogram age 31. Terrified by news of calcifications. \nNow age 69, no family history, NO alcohol, enthusiastic exerciser, not fat. \nIn between, 4 biopsies\u2014all benign. \nCountless mammograms, many at intervals of 6 months in the 1990s, when kids were young. Lived in constant fear of cancer death sentence. One day a radiologist walked in after mammogram with my paper medical records and said: \u201cThis has to stop.\u201d \nResumed annual mammograms. Tried to stop frantic neurotic self-exams, eventually succeeded. \nEventually came the ominous \u201cyou might have DCIS\u201d \u2014 more X-rays, MRI, core needle biopsy. Sent to surgeon who EAGERLY described what she\u2019d do when the DCIS diagnosis was made. \nHad surgical biopsy. Negative. Got distinct impression that surgeon was disappointed. That was 10 years ago, and even I knew back then that DCIS wasn\u2019t cancer. But what really bothered me was the surgeon\u2019s explanation to me of her very aggressive battle plan to treat DCIS (which it turned out I didn\u2019t have). \nI finally came to my senses then re surgeons wanting to do surgery, put myself on an 18-month schedule for mammograms, and will never get another biopsy without a second opinion first.",
        "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2016, with a Gleason score of 6. I took a year to consider my options including surgery, radiation, and \"watchful waiting\" (which means only monitoring it.) I opted for robotic surgery and had my prostate removed in January 2017. By that time, the Gleason score had advanced to 7 and the cancer had expanded within the prostate. Since my surgery my PSA has been zero, and I have been \"cancer-free.\"\n\nI have no doubt that this was the correct decision and have no regrets about opting for surgery. Prostate cancer is the #2 killer of men and having it removed and out of my body was a HUGE psychological relief (as well as a physical one).\n\nThe effort to minimize the risk and to call cancer by some euphemistic, neutral term totally discounts the patient's peace of mind and mental relief achieved by removal of the cancer. This is most unfortunate. And simply relying on a Gleason score of 6 or below would not have worked in my case.\n\nFinally, medical \"profit\" was not a factor at all in my case. I consulted with a half-dozen physicians and a number of prostate patients. Not a single person advocated for one therapy over another. I found the entire process to be informative with no agendas -- hidden or otherwise. I ultimately made my decision based on my assessment of the facts, without pressure from anyone.",

        "Medical editor here. I specialized in working with this country\u2019s leading breast cancer researchers, writing grants to the National Cancer Institute. I\u2019m not a doctor, but have helped their writing for three decades. \n\nI could not possibly disagree with this essay more. I was fortune to help raise funding  for what we now call personalized medicine \u2014 genetic and genomic tests that can pinpoint one\u2019s exact type of cancer and its likely prognosis. \n\nI benefited from that wonderful science a year ago, when diagnosed with stage 1a DCIS, estrogen receptor positive. First, it HAD spread to several lymph nodes. Second, although estrogen blocking drugs do slow or halt spread of ER+ cancer, the side effects of the drugs are worse than surgery or radiation. My 59-year-old joints are now as stiff and painful as a woman in her 80s. \n\nI elected bilateral lumpectomy and short radiation.  My surgeon conserved my breast so well that even my husband can\u2019t tell I had surgery. I quit taking the dreaded drugs, as I\u2019d rather face more surgery and radiation that those mothers. \n\nEveryone\u2019s reaction is different. But telling cancer patients they have some unpronounceable condition and not to worry about it borders on malpractice. Cancers can and do spread. Worse, people generally don\u2019t take good care of their health. (Been to a Walmart lately?) People should not be lulled into a possibly false sense of security abut their lives.",
        "Equally important in my opinion is the consideration of treatment for certain forms of invasive cancer. My sister had a stage one invasive ductal carcinoma. Her first surgeon insisted on a mastectomy and strongly recommended a double mastectomy. \n\nAfter seeking a second opinion, she was assured that her type of cancer was not aggressive and could be treated with a lumpectomy and radiation. Eight years later she remains cancer free. \n\nThe point is that even with some invasive cancers, less invasive treatments can be an option.",
        "All I know is that when the learned academic medicos promulgated mammograms every two years instead of annually, a half dozen of our women friends were subsequently diagnosed with later stage breast cancers than if they had been screened earlier. More lumpectomies! More chemo and radiation! Rationing diagnostics does not make cancer go away!",
        "When I was first diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer 14 years ago I was terrified and even aghast that I was the one who would ultimately make the treatment decision, with ample support from Dartmouth\u2019s exceptional urology team.  The percentage of men deciding on active surveillance was quite low at the time but with information and encouragement that\u2019s what I opted to do. After the first couple of stressful years I fell into a routine of semi annual PSAs and biopsies every couple of years.  Long story short, what turned out to hopefully be my last biopsy earlier this year came up with only normal tissue. No cancer in sight. It\u2019s most likely still around but at this point undetectable. And for the first time since 2008, I have no checkups, appointments or PSAs on my calendar.  For men with Gleason 6, simply monitoring this level of cancer is somewhat stressful because you feel like you should do \u201csomething\u201d, particularly at first, but that worry fades with time and the medical technology that can regularly monitor your PC status keeps you  \nhealthy and safe.",
        "In 2017 I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, Gleason 6. My original Dr. advised immediate surgery. I got a 2nd opinion from Sloan Kettering and advised to do active surveillance which i did with them for 5 years. I did MRIs every 2 yrs and blood tests every 6 months. After 5 years I was told I needed surgery which Sloan did successfully. It was learned after surgery that the cancer was certain to spread if I continued to wait so everything Sloan told me was correct and I am very happy with the results.",

        "I was diagnosed with DCIS. I did ask the surgeon if surgery was necessary. She informed me I could wait and see if it became something more aggressive. I did opt for the surgery and I am glad I did because my tumor turned out to be Stage 1 breast cancer requiring surgery and radiation.\n\nOne really doesn\u2019t know how one might react when told they have cancer. Maybe if I didn\u2019t have great insurance, I would have taken the wait and see approach. I am grateful I could get the proper treatment.",
        "I was diagnosed with DCIS 2.5 years ago and was fortunate enough to have been referred to one of the small handful of breast surgeons who immediately assured me that I did not have cancer; cancer by definition is invasive.

Patient decision aids exist for many decisions where there\u2019s more than one reasonable choice and many incorporate the best available evidence.

Insurers are afraid to authorize MRI\u2019s because of \u201ccost\u201d but eventually got an MRI of the lower back for a back injury after months of ineffective PT and waiting (the MRI also incidentally images the prostate).

MRI is exquisitely suited for a variety of soft tissue injuries and diseases, yet is disparaged by insurers as \u201coverdiagnosing\u201d.  $200 is a trivial cost (too low in fact) compared to the value of knowing whether or not to move to aggressive treatment.",

Most would live into their 80s in good enough \"health\" to continue to work, mow their lawns, go on cruises, etc. Maybe barber shops and hairdressers would do IV's too (barbers used to do minor surgery)..\n\nI got this idea because I had a friend who was a nuclear medicine researcher who had even founded the department in a major university and wrote the textbook.",
        "In a for profit health care system it\u2019s income (revenue) rather than outcomes that take priority.",
        "Agree entirely with the perspectives and options outlined in the article.  If the United States truly had a \u201chealthcare system\u201d with a single payer the suggestions and changes might actually happen. In the current US healthcare system one is fighting the economic gorilla that doing more (surgery, chemo,radiation) generates more income because of the fee for service system. Additionally, the manufacturers and oncology organizations would lose dollars.  Until the payment structures are changed positive changes for patients will be very difficult, if not impossible to change.",
        "My \u201cDCIS\u201d was actually stage 1b after the lumpectomy tissue went to pathology.",
        "this would be wonderful if everyone had equal access to screening and follow-up measures but our current healthcare system cannot support the level of patient care nationwide that this would require",
        "This may be one of the most important columns of the year in the Times. No one wants to hear that they went through painful surgery/procedures unnecessarily, but apparently that's what is happening to MANY people. Yes, it may be a matter of profit, but I think it's easy for some medical professionals to go after everything with brute force because then they can't be accused of ignoring illnesses. As other posters note, the entire philosophy of medicine and health needs to be changed in this country. There need to be many more stories like this.",
        "Surgery is a billable event. I\u2019d like to see the difference in earnings for a hospital when the decision between surveillance and observation, medical treatment, and surgical treatment are laid side by side.",
        "What about Basal Cell Carcinoma of the skin?",
        "Six Years ago I had a prostate biopsy with a Gleason score of 6. My urologist recommended (almost insisted) on monitoring. His comment was the treatment was worse than the disease. Within a year it had risen to 7. I had surgery and am fine. My point is it seems like these recommendations were already put in practice 6 years ago. What I don\u2019t like is the push for everyone to get a PSA test without letting people know what happens when the test comes back higher than normal.",
        "Get care at an academic center that follows protocols. You end up with better outcomes and evidence based medicine.",
        "Waiting and monitoring do not get to the root cause. How about a genetic workup, or at least enough bloodwork to determine immune system issues?  A simple vitamin D level determination to start with?",
        "@Jake S. Well said - I too was diagnosed with stage zero DCIS last year and when I asked two surgeons and a medical oncologist if I couldn\u2019t adopt a \u201cwatch and wait\u201d approach, I was told \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough data\u201d. My family was anxious, which played into my decision to have treatment. I proceeded with the lumpectomy and radiation but my type was not estrogen receptive, so no chemo. I also just completed a reconstructive surgery. All of this was painful, inconvenient and expensive. But as Jake points out, why would a surgeon not recommend surgery?  It\u2019s how they make their money and of course have the hammer of malpractice lawsuits hanging over the heads.",
        "Always, always get a second opinion.  Early stage cancers do not need to be treated immediately. Be your own advocate and take the time to gather information before deciding on a plan of treatment.",
        "On the other hand, there are cases like mine where an elevated PSA score was noted during my annual exam but dismissed as insignificant by my physician assistant because I had no symptoms.  An adverse reaction to a Covid-19 booster shot brought me back to my primary care provider just three months later when another PSA was taken, which showed an even higher PSA score.  Getting in to see a urologist took another two months which led to a biopsy, which confirmed a benign cell type but nonetheless aggressive tumor.\n   \nHad I not experienced a severe vasculitis from the Covid-19 vaccine, I would still be waiting for my annual physical exam with an advanced and deadly tumor.   As is, despite a pre-surgical PET scan showing no metastasis and lymph node frozen sections at the time of surgery being negative, post-prostate surgery I still have an elevated PSA and the post-surgical biopsy showed a higher grade tumor.\n   \nAggressive treatment was the correct approach in my case.  I now face radiation treatment and a five-year survival rate of 30% despite feeling fine.",
        "All good ideas. The current system makes adoption of them slow and uneven. In the meantime, we patients have to figure out what's right and then try to get medical professionals to do it. I don't mean to be a complainer but that's how things are on the ground.",
        "There is a cost to this for patients with more advanced disease who wait for treatment. Of course the health care system gets fees for lots of procedures and an inflated success ratio.",
        "Great article. We are entering an age where many cancers are treatable, and it makes sense that some of the early stage lesions be called what they are--pre-cancerous. People accept this idea with moles, for example: they should keep an eye on them and report any changes to their doctor.",
        "I am in complete agreement with this. I was diagnosed with Stage 0, DCIS. Stage zero mind you. The stages go up to Stage four (4). The medical community was totally on me to get lumpectomy surgery, even full mastectomy, followed by 6 weeks of daily radiation and the 5 years of chemo. That seemed way way overkill. They did scare me into getting a lumpectomy, which I now regret because it has weakened my arm and lympnode system. It's crazy.",
        "This sounds thoughtful and reasonable--we should do this. How do we encourage this change?",
        "Finally figured out what the word metastasis means. I mean, I knew it meant spread all over, but never took the time to realize it was a compound of meta and stasis, literally meaning at a higher state or level above base state. We pronounce it metas-tisis, breaking up and obscuring its constituent parts.",
        "When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  This is why I avoid doctors as much as possible."
