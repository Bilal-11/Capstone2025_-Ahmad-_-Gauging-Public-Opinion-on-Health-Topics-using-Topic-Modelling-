        "The warning label should be on all social media platforms. Period. Regardless of age. \n\nThe social media platforms are infested with lies and disinformation. It's gotten to the point that I believe almost nothing on the internet or social media.\n\nIf you're an adult and you want to ignore it, that's your right.\nMuch like warnings on smoking cigarettes which have been proven beyond doubt to kill humans, you're free to smoke.\n\nNow that this suggestion has been made by the Surgeon General, watch the social media companies pour billions fighting against it with every means possible - TV, print, hiring lobbyists, contributing (paying off) lawmakers, etc.\n\nTheir number one defense will be that their first amendment rights are being infringed.\n\nOf course with a radical, activist, hard core right-wing extremist MAGA Republican Supreme Court, they will probably be protected from the Surgeon General's suggestion..",
        "Where does the nanny state end? The government can not fix everything!",
        "On twitter and facebook my common thought is my writing good, intellectual, politically correct and as close to 'G' rated writing I can manage. My friends may all be adults, but I don't know if their children are looking on my site. So rarely any sex, or drugs and I always try to be safe with my opinions. The president is the only one I blame for our woo's(ex pres too) and rarely do any cuts or finger pointing. By choosing to follow through a safe conduct of speech is just safety social behavior.",
        "That's hilarious doc. \nwhat about surgeon general warnings for junk food? \nmicroplastics? \ndirty air, water, and soil? the \"forever\" chemicals? \nthe gun violence? \nthe F.A.A. sure did a great job with Boeing eh? \njust like the DEA is all over oxycontin, and the FDA is concerned primarily with bribes from Big Pharma and Big Ag- oops I meant your health and safety  \nhow well we protect our children? when is your next standup routine in Vegas/",
        "Those red hats are all the warning label we need.",
        "As an early pioneer of social media & CEO of the longest standing social media related company in the world, I think it\u2019s fine to add the Surgeon General\u2019s suggested warning label to the platforms.  Alas it will do very little to address the issues at hand.  \n\nThose being child self-esteem and mental health, privacy, data protection, harassment, & disinformation. Warnings and regulations are good, but they won\u2019t accomplish much in the face of the emotional draws of human nature that drive social media.  \n\nPeople are on social media because they want to be there. Connecting people, enabling and supporting positive relationships, building positive social movements, education, and more. Social media fills a human need for connection in an increasingly disconnected world. Most people will ignore labels. The proposed rules regulations help some, but don\u2019t address the core dynamics and are easy to get around.  As one example, when COPPA first came into existence, not allowing children under 13 to access to Internet sites, we found the next day there was a surge in the population of 14 year olds.\n\nWhat then can we do?  The answer is exceptionally simple and easy to implement, but it requires the greatest of will power. We must educate our children on up in how to use, navigate, and manage social media with an emphasis on critical thinking.  Adults as well plus how to manage their children\u2019s access to social media. \n\n Peter Friedman, LiveWorld",
        "Thanks for taking initiative on this major problem. I fully support this. Bravo!",
        "I completely agree with everything written here.  The essay concludes \"Our children's well-being is at stake.\"  Right again.  But on the other side is money.  Which side will win?",
        "I am grateful for this action.  A warning label can only warn, but it provides context for thinking about our actions.  The label stands as a sign at the door--be wary, be mindful, think about it before entering.  It was high time and perhaps a good first step to opening space for better conversations and understandings about these platforms.  We may worry about the young, but frankly, I have learned that I can't really trust myself.  The damage is incredible on young people.  Putting the screens away is very healthy.  Moreover--Read.  Read books.  Read banned books.",
        "I am a mother of 3 kids attending public elementary, middle, and high schools, and none of them have smartphones or social media. I am also the author of a new book on this topic (Childhood Unplugged, 2023, and a Substack newsletter called The Analog Family). \n\nWhile I appreciate the Surgeon General's intention, I am so very tired of parents passing the buck to companies, politicans, doctors, and various \"experts\" to try to mitigate the harms of these platforms and devices when they themselves are the ones with the most influence on a child's life. But many parents don't want to do the dirty work of saying no. It's easier to wait around for someone else to do it. Partly, I wonder if this is because they'd be forced to face their own screen time overuse habits. \n\nThis social media-induced problem wouldn't be nearly as big if parents simply said no to their kids. It's absolutely possible. I'm living proof. I'm doing it on a daily basis. It's not always easy or fun. But it's preferable to dealing with the fallout from cyberbullying, and shattered self-esteem, and self-harm, and depression, and, heaven forbid, suicide. \n\nThis is not about blaming parents. This should be an empowering message. You CAN say no. It's never too late. You're not alone.",
        "Thank you for this story and your efforts to protect kids. Personally, I think social media is plenty harmful to adults, too. I feel so much happier after deleting my Facebook account several years ago and haven't missed it one single bit. When I think of all the time I wasted scrolling through that endless feed like a zombie, reading about the idealized lives of \"friends,\" looking at simplistic memes, and attempting to combat the rampant misinformation people so eagerly shared there (an impossible task), I want to kick myself. Life is so short, and I wish I could have that time back.",
        "The graphic associated with this article brings up a related issue with devices.  Using them in the dark to read, search, or use social media exposes the eyes to very bright light at close range.  I have not researched this, but I believe my macular degeneration is die at least in part to such usage.  (Only my left eye is affected, due in my mind to that eye receiving the strongest exposure due to my position.)\nReading under the covers with a flashlight is a time-honored childhood tradition but users should be warned of the physical impact of using a backlit device in this way.",
        "Algorithmic social media is the cigarette of the 21st century.\n\nTwenty years from now we are going to look at giving an 8-year-old a smartphone like we would giving an 8-year-old a pack of smokes.\n\nMaybe social media is as safe as Big Tech claims, maybe not, but we shouldn't run the experiment on our kids.",
        "A good first step, but I'd like to see social media regulated as a drug.",
        "We need to back to a model of the FTC regulating TV and radio.  It used to be that you had to actively seek out adult content, and pay more for it.  E.g. you had fairly tame broadcast TV, but would have to make an active decision to pay for HBO, Cinemax, Playboy, etc.\n\nThings have flipped.  If you (and you kids) have access to the internet, you have access to everything.  You have to actively monitor, block, and educate yourself about the latest threats.  Parents need to pay for blocking software to block out inappropriate content.\n\nKids will stumble upon porn--innocently clicking an ad or link.  You have to consistently increase your privacy settings to avoid predators/scammers trying to friend you, send you inappropriate content, tag you in things, etc.  \n\nBasically, you have to constantly and actively seek to avoid adult content.  It used to be that you had to actively seek it out.",
        "How about a warning label on the American healthcare system as it is far more dangerous than social media.",
        "Such a well meaning civilized argument offering a calibrated response to the societal menace of social media. Good luck persuading a community hardwired into extremist notions of freedoms even at the expense of self harm, and harm to the society and the world at large. Where the dogma of \"individual\" above all is religion, where the Supreme Court just bumped the stock of assault weapons for personal use, you want to nudge caution in use of social media by warning folks, backed by data and examples. Sounds tragically naiive. The bogey man of nanny state is screaming murder already ... !",
        "Good first step.  But, how is \"social media\" defined?  Yes, the traditional social media companies are pretty bad, but there are a lot of negative impacts for sites and apps that aren't considered social media per se.  For example:\nDid you know Spotify has porn?\nYouTube--even YouTube Kids--is a hotbed for horrible content\nGroup chats can be awful for bullying, sextortion, and more\n\nPerhaps this warning should be extended to smart phones, not just social media?",
        "Maybe we need a different approach.  Maybe a Propaganda Czar who could mobilize forces to  gradually spread the idea that it is   'uncool' to spend hours on your screen. If this somehow took hold, it would deter a lot of school age children and young adults. No one wants to be 'uncool'. For the rest of humanity, it would be a loud, ever -present reminder that too much Internet is not good for mind nor body.",
        "Not enough...\n\nI personally have no social media at all, a decision I made about 20 years ago-I tend to endeavor in personal things in the flesh, not on a screen, but my biggest instinct has unfortunately a reality.\n\nMy concern was of what's happening only a bit now, and will get progressively worse, in a short time. The impact of ID theft, the impact of fraudulent companies who claim they are reporting agencies (I am suing one as we speak) and all the nightmares of a loss of \"privacy\" which had a stronger more meaningful meaning back then.\n\n The fact is that social has caused the entire proliferation of privacy violations all by themselves. The cameras at nearly every street light, they don't just watch the cars running the red lights, stop signs, or simply turning right too quickly after a rolling stop-no. They are watching with very wide angle zoom lenses EVERYTHING around that camera for almost the entire 360 degrees.\n\n If we go outside, someone now knows more about us than WE do, more about if you fixed your hair, picked your nose, or whatever else you thought no one else would ever notice, guess what EVERYONE else now can notice...not for me, and a very wise decision.\n\nThe summary of this though is more simplistic: Not just an entry warning label, but a label on each group (at entry, each time) and each chat, and each of everything these platforms have used to completely destroy the word \"privacy\". As the SS admins told me, everyone's been compromised-no exceptions...",
        "I agree with all the recommendations in this excellent article from our surgeon general.  I would add that our core curriculum also be updated to include mandatory classes on the safe use of social media, information discernment, and how to exercise critical thinking in a digital society. This is especially important now that AI has entered into the equation.",
        "Here's a novel idea.\nInstead of a warning label, why not hold social media companies culpable for spreading misinformation and memes that are obviously dangerous?",
        "As a parent of three who was completely outsmarted by my kids, tech, and screens, all I can say is good luck.",
        "A WARNING LABEL on social media is absolutely warranted in a nation of free speech.",
        "It is critically important that YouTube also be in the discussion.  Its algorithms feed toxic content to teens and preteens.",
        "I got to know the parents of my kids when the kids were all still young.  As the kids got older, the parents made the effort to openly discuss planned approaches for cell phones and social media.  We all agreed to wait until at least high school, and even then, to have a lot of restrictions on it.\n\nThe kids are in middle school now.  In elementary school, very few kids had phones.  That abruptly changed in middle school.  But our kids are all still friends and all still are phone free, and have very strict limitations on screen time and very limited access to the internet.\n\nBut, they are all in the same boat and so far it's not a huge struggle.  They can complain about their luddite parents together--in person!!--and we're ok with that.  They all seem really happy and well adjusted.  \n\nI know tech is coming for them eventually, but I'm happy to delay it for a few more years.\n\nParents:  talk to each other!  Band together!!  It is SO MUCH EASIER to navigate these waters when you have each others' backs.",
        "Dr. Murthy, a warning label for social media is entirely useless. No child between 10 and 18 cares what the Surgeon General thinks, never has, never will. What you are doing is raising a post-Covid profile of meddling uninformedly that is already too large and so damage the post of Surgeon General (more). What you should do is first get a study done that clearly correlates, measures and compares the harm that different platforms seem to inflict on different ages and cohorts. (And that will not be easy since people are lazy enough to just self-report everything bad on social media, since this is the prevailing but unproven narrative.) Then you will have to find out how exactly the damage is done and then you will hopefully be able to pinpoint this to the parts of the algorithms that are doing the harm. Then, maybe, you will be able devise adequate countermeasures (which might not be in the realm of the social media at all). Now, today I will stop mindlessly watching youtube shorts (which I do more than my kid).",
        "Murthy's action here is well-intentioned and commendable.  Sadly, it is also useless.  It will have little or no effect, and is obviously unenforceable.\n\nIt is parents (some of whom are, themselves, addicted to social media) who need to (try to) control social media usage by their children.  Yet that is probably also a losing battle.  Social media has ingrained itself far too strongly into the youth culture (in particular) for \"warnings\" to be taken seriously, much less heeded.\n\nFor those parent wishing to read the two best books written on this subject (and recommend them to their children, assuming their children still actually READ), I would highly recommend:\n\nThe Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World, by Max Fisher\n\nand\n\nDigital Madness: How Social Media is Driving Our Mental Health Crisis and How to Restore Our Sanity, by Nicholas Kardaras, Ph.D.\n\nThere have been dozens of storylines on this issue in films and TV shows over the years since social media arrived.  Yet they have had little if any effect on the children watching those films and TV shows.\n\nOn the other side, according to several articles (including in the NYT), there ARE groups of teens around the U.S. who are either eschewing social media or limiting their time on it, because they see and feel the adverse effects of it.  Bravo.  We need more of this, and more PSAs and whatever else we can do to get the warning out in a way in which children will actually hear it.",
        "I am all for addressing this issue, however, I fail to see how this solution will actually lead to demonstrable change and benefit for young people. Does anyone think that parental advisory labels on music and video games deters ANYONE who wants those items from getting them? And in a digital space, those warnings are even easier to ignore (looking at you Facebook/Twitter with your \"fake news\" warning labels that affected no one). \n\nIf we really care about the impact of social media on users (underage or adult) then perhaps Congress should do it's job and regulate those platforms like utilities \u2014 and maybe even require a little age/identity verification (blue checkmark!). That's how you make a lasting impact on the problem. A warning label is a bandaid that addresses the symptom but not the problem.",
        "Lordy was I lucky to grow up before social media existed, my son too was adult before this advent. So lucky. I pity whoever is young in today\u2019s world for more reasons than one.",
        "In my university class, I asked my students at what age did they receive a smart phone. The average age was 13. I then asked them when will you let your children have a smart phone when you have children. The average age was 18. They know this was bad for them.  If you are a teacher, ask your students these questions.",
        "I thank Dr Murthy for sharing this opinion piece. He describes the rationale of such a policy at both a public health and individual health level. \n\nI describe myself as a balanced person who thinks I can assess risk well but didn\u2019t directly link social media consumption to mental health. As a medical and public health microbiologist, I see this risk reduction strategy as an important step forward. Like many others, the pandemic has negatively impacted my mental health and on reflection, the higher consumption of social media over the years didn\u2019t help. I can only imagine the harm social media has wrought in children and adolescents since the pandemic. \n\nOn a personal level, I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue and I\u2019ve just put significant limits on all my social media apps! Maybe I can wean myself off completely soon!",
        "Yes, social media is a problem not only with teens but in the divide we have now in our country with politics.  I am sitting on a train in a beautiful part of Switzerland where mountains and lakes abound and next to me and over to the next seats on the right there are 3 young men between 17 and 22 about. They are all plugged into their cell phones.  They are not interacting with one another or looking at the beautiful view.  How sad I think that reality takes second place to the digital info they are getting.  It is not just Social Media, it is the big tech companies that are pushing, pushing, and pushing, to get you addicted to your phone, from banking, information on everything, texting, games, sports, and music...it is all now on your cell phone pushing for more dependency to your phone.  I see people crossing the street on their phones and wonder how many of them get killed every year because they are so absorbed in their phones they don't see or hear a car coming.  Sad but Capitalism does not care about the damage they do to the environment, quality of life of the average person, or health, it cares about the bottom line for its investors and the investors need to realize that they are paying the price for a few more dollars in the bank, for themselves and their children.",
        "I have a question: Is YouTube considered social media in this context?",
        "Cool, cool. Social media can cause real harm. \n\nBut can/will these labels actually curb usage? They might raise awareness, but can they improve things? Or will they simply serve as a reminder that we're doing something harmful? And will that reminder just make us all feel worse about what we're already doing (and going to do)?\n\nI say this because warning labels are everywhere now. Have you ever bought food or an ice cream maker or anything really with a California Proposition 65 label? I swear, this warning is on everything. It reminds us that whatever it is we're eating or using can potentially cause cancer or other harm. But we're already using it or eating it. So now we have the knowledge that we're doing something harmful on top of the actual possible harm. Double harm? Or perhaps a deterrent to eat that thing or use that machine ever again? I dunno.",
        "There's hardly a segment of civilization left that is not Begging for meaningful regulation on this: CONGRESS, where are You?!",
        "First, let's call it by an accurate name:  ANTI-SOCIAL Media.\n\nIMO:\n\nSmart phones (micro computers with limited functionality for productive use) should be prohibited for anyone under 17.  IF a young person needs a phone for actual phone calls, let them have a old style flip phone.  \n\nFor adults, the speakerphone feature needs to be removed.  I'm disgusted by all the people who think the rest of us need to hear their conversations emitted from a metallic-irritating-speaker.\n\nMoving to an area with no cell signals may be in my future.  :-|",

        "As a 65 year old, I was late joining social media, but felt obliged to, since many of my friends were on it . After building up a portfolio (due to algorithmic suggestions for ' friends' of 174 contacts, I eventually dropped out six months ago as it was doing my head in. I'm currently enjoying floating in my peaceful backwater, hiding in the reeds, with an account I opened in order to maintain contact with a charity to which I subscribe but otherwise never post anything from. It's like pre-social media days again, with real friends, contactable on a face to face basis, no white noise and clutter, and very agreeable.  Friendship running on MS DOS, as you do \ud83d\ude00",
        "According to Dr. Murthy, \u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned in medical school was that in an emergency, you don\u2019t have the luxury to wait for perfect information.\u201d\n\nHow true! If only that advice weren\u2019t applied so selectively. \n\nIt seems that warning labels can be applied in this emergency because, hey, it\u2019s just a label. But in summer 2020 I was begging the public health establishment to release the vaccine to all who wanted it because we didn\u2019t have time to wait for perfect information, and the response was uniform: \u201cNo, we must wait until the vaccine has been absolutely proven safe and effective.\u201d\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t the only one: a Johns-Hopkins professor proposed distributing the Covid vaccine ahead of trials, only to be shamed the very next day into printing a retraction that he clearly didn\u2019t even believe: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2020/08/03/i-was-wrong-we-cant-skip-phase-3-vaccine-trials\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2020/08/03/i-was-wrong-we-cant-skip-phase-3-vaccine-trials</a>/\n\nI think the distinction being made here is that warning labels on social media don\u2019t sound like medicine, but vaccines do. If a label produces some bad result, the medical establishment can say \u201cdon\u2019t look at us - the label is just words, and we\u2019re doctors, not wordsmiths.\u201d It\u2019s much harder to make that argument with vaccines.\n\nBut this point about acting without perfect information was the opening line in an article arguing for the radical step of declaring some speech to be a health hazard. If that\u2019s the principle, let\u2019s at least apply it consistently.",

They will continue to smoke if they want to, and children and adults will use the internet no matter what. Who really thinks a 16 year old believes that if they avoid the conversations they usually have online it will lessen their stress/depression levels? The warnings should be bold and blunt, that many times information presented as fact is nonsense or exaggerated or totally false to persuade someone to think differently about some subject.

That is not hyperbole. It has the same effects on our brains and health as many powerful, heavy-regulated and illegal substances.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to exist in our society without using social media. About three years ago I deleted all of my accounts. The environment was too toxic and, after being so involved with social media during the pandemic, I needed a detox. The positive results of being off were immediate. I began working out more, I began practicing more (I\u2019m a professional musician), I began studying Spanish with a private tutor three days a week (I have continued, have traveled to Spain twice in the past 18 months and am studying for language certification through the Spanish government). Most of all, I became happier.\n\nI recently left a steady performance job. It was a bad fit. One consistently, huge sticking point? Social media. They consistently wanted to use our (performers\u2019) social media networks to promote their brand. Well, I don\u2019t have a social media network. \n\nBegrudgingly, I recently rejoined two of the biggest platforms. I don\u2019t follow anyone. I\u2019m just there, unsure how to exist. I am now performing for some new, better, companies. At a recent performance the venue hired a professional photographer.

Often, drastic action. And because often drastic action was needed an entire machinery to amplify emotions into passions exists... Many of which activate the fight or flight reflex, and the powerful hormones and neurohormones tied to them.  \n\nThe Internet can activate all this basic emotional machinery in situations where there is no real life pushback (to moderate exacerbated passions) nor any justification grounded in action. Thus Social Networks can activate say the adrenal glands, raise the cortisol, create physiological stress\u2026 for which no relief would ever be coming\u2026 because no real life action is connected to the Social Networks input.\n\nRaising stress causes physiological problems, impacts the immune system, brings addictive behaviors\u2026 may be one of the reasons why cancer incidence is growing in younger people. \n\nSocial Networks train a lot of people to run on empty, in a fake reality that exists mostly as a nonlinear loop between increasingly sick minds and some big data center AI somewhere feeding them more and more of what makes them tick by making them sick.

This propagated mostly by word of mouth, and it was more effective than King James\u2019s \u201cblast of the trumpet\u201d had been when tobacco shipments first started arriving in England from Virginia Colony.

        "I am not on any social media, but I was middle aged before this became ubiquitous. I feel for young adults and people with children. The technology has taken over. Some of it is necessary (using a computer to write a document or build a spreadsheet), a lot of it is not (social media). For young people who do not recall a pre-smart phone age they have no comparison point to how negative the social media use is - it is a mostly a waste of time and energy that uses your eyeballs to make money. At least when I spend time on a legitimate news website I am supporting journalism. The same cannot be said of most of social media. There is very little to no legitimate purpose. But the young literally don\u2019t know a world without it and fear missing out on something that is actually unimportant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI applaud the warnings but is there more that should be done? Will the warnings enable is to sue social media companies?",

One thing we really have a handle on is every click and every second spent by everybody on online. If that sounds scary, it should. That's the status quo. Let's just start with the big ones. It should be neither so easy nor so profitable to consume or purvey social, psychological, cultural and political poisons. Freedom of Speech never meant no one ever had to pay for media.",
        "In 1980 I did a research paper in high school based on the book \"TV the Plug In Drug\". It explained the effects watching  too much TV has on a developing brain. Watching, being entertained with no effort or interactive thought process causes one side of the brain to develop more than the other. The side responsible for creativity, original thought and problem solving doesn't develop fully. I witnessed this in my 5 yr old step-brother who was babysat by the TV when at his biological mother's house, and had been for years. She had full custody until he started 1st grade. My mother, a 2nd grade teacher, convinced all parties based, on his developmental status, that he'd be much better off living with us. He would sit in class expecting to be entertained and not participate without constant prompting. \n\nI have to believe that similar brain damage is happening to kids staring at a phone or computer screen for long periods of time. I realize if they are interacting with others it  requires a somewhat higher degree of thought and brain activity, but maybe not much more. They certainly can't learn how to behave in socially appropriate ways without personal interaction, learning body language, hearing a tone of voice or engaging in conversation. \n\nI applaud the Surgeon General. I hope changes will be made by the companies involved, the parents, teachers, kids themselves, and adults in general. Brain damage is occurring on a massive scale and we can't continue to ignore that fact.",

These companies are excellent at monetizing engagement and they make a lot of money. A couple of ideas for some counter programming -- we could charge tech companies 1% of revenue and re-invest in our schools, parks, community centers, etc. We need to get kids so interested, busy and invested in other activities they simply have less time for media and instead develop new skills, confidence, friends \"IRL\" and a sense of their future. Just 1% - call it a Kids Tax!  Second, we could do something really huge like add a Secretary of Youth to the president's cabinet. Make it a full-time, empowered, cabinet-level job to think about America's kids and work on everything -- school, climate, tech, government -- to give them their best chance at happy, safe and fulfilling lives. Do more than punish a few companies for their products.

They themselves know it. Once, I asked them to imagine that phones themselves are banned altogether (not just during the school day, say) for everyone under 18. I expected an outraged response. But, the relief and longing that came upon their faces and flooded the room was...heartbreaking to see. \n\nSmart phones have become, for our kids, places where a social arms race is taking place. The kids have to have one, and their parents have to give them one, because everyone else has one; without one, they would be entirely isolated from the social interactions and groupings that are so important to adolescents.\n\nBut if no one has one, they'll be missing out on nothing at all, and can just be free--free from the endless need to scroll, like, post, all of it just to fit in.\n\nBan smart phones for every kid under 18. The kids will be healthier and happier (although they'll probably pretend they won't be), and their parents will be too.\n\nThe only ones who won't be happy are our tech overlords. Oh, bummer.",

And some students are known to obtain medications to treat the self-diagnosed mental issues through non-professional resources. \n\nSocial media and the associated technology have significant effects on adolescents\u2019 physical functions. The use of computers, smartphones, and social media is associated with shorter sleep duration, higher levels of daytime fatigue, and longer times for children and adolescents to fall asleep. \n\nSocial media sites promote obesity and eating disorders in adolescents. In addition, social media sites are platforms for a worldwide audience where adolescents can be subjected to racism, homophobia, transphobia and cyberbullying.\n\nSome social media platform facilitate substance use among adolescents by allowing for peer-to-peer messaging with features that support substance use. \n\nIt is for all of these reasons and much more that a surgeon general's warning label is needed on social media platforms.",

Many American parents cave on teen phone ownership when they hear the excuse of \"safety\" - - don't they want their treasured teens to be able to call in emergencies, and get home safely? In Asia, even young kids ubiquitously wear smart watches with cellular service. Part of the reason for that is because phone service for the watch is just a buck or two a month, and the other reason is that allows parents to solve the \"safety\" problem without turning over a weapon of mass distraction to their kids. \n\nWhether they realize it or not, American parents have options.

She wrote a novel during the pandemic, which exposed all the dysfunctional people in our family as thinly shrouded characters, but I realized how aware she was of people. She had group chats with friends and did Zooms. She was always a bit of outsider in our neighborhood as the competitive moms enforced social boundaries, but she won people over just by being a fun silly girl. Parents would say she kept the girls up all night at slumber parties but she made them howl with laughter. She uses wit and fun to be social in person, and she had to work hard to stay relevant that way. But when she was allowed to use social media freshman year, she had no appetite.",

Even attempt to ban certain Apps such as TikTok are futile efforts intended more ot create the image of \"doing something\" rather than actually achieving it.\n\nIt would appear that Dr. Murthy feels pressure to address this issue almost with the resigned admission that about all he can do is put a label on an App.\n\nSociety, particularly younger members, are indeed facing a crisis based on technological advances that are essentially uncontrollable.\n\nIf we are now concerned with Social Media's impact on children consider the far greater potentially negative impact of AI.\n\nWe are already rapidly approaching a point where AI systems are achieving levels of knowledge that exceeds that of a substantial number of people.\n\nIf you think Social Media is now dangerous for children imagine a few years from now when AI tools are both instructing and indoctrinating them.",
        "Bravo! It would also help a great deal if ADULTS would model social media and phone restraint.  How often do you see young adults wheeling a baby in a stroller while on their cell phones instead of paying attention (eye contact, talking etc) with their baby.  How many adults buy babies play toys that resemble phones or tablets.  Young children mimic their parents. How about adults teaching their offspring the benefits of reading, playing outdoors, playing with other kids, working out their differences through talking and just engaging with the world around you?",
        "Am I the only parent of teens who largely do not use social media to talk to peers? They do use video sites to search clips, but kids have been scared out of using social media with their real names & photos by health classes already. \n\nI find a huge piece of the anxiety puzzle is the lack of autonomy & lack of responsibility given to children at age appropriate levels. They don\u2019t go outside much, don\u2019t meet friends in their neighborhoods. They don\u2019t have third spaces to develop social skills. They don\u2019t learn to drive as quickly, which means many don\u2019t work while in HS.\n\nAnd everything is a big deal. We turn school into a massive competition. Tough classes, grades are a big deal, ACT/SAT scores must be high. Activities must be plentiful. College is massively expensive and rent is as well.\n\nI think social media is such a small piece of the puzzle. The key to solving the anxiety problem is to create community & trust in each other. Including price regulations on essential goods. Without that there\u2019s no lock or accountability device that will save us from a world that\u2019s so unforgiving & difficult.",

Students cannot sit it class for 5 minutes without the urge to check their phones. Many sit in the cafeteria next to each other without talking, just engaged on their phones. I saw a significant increase in online bullying and the number of students with anxiety disorders in the last five years of my career. Society needs to demand help from Congress. All schools need to ban cell phones during school hours. If there is an emergency, parents can call the school's main office to relay a message. We need to restore sanity and learning in schools.",
        "Maybe someday we'll all understand social media as a pale substitute for real interaction, as a fallback rather than a default. \n\nNo idea on how this happens, but it seems like there needs to be a broad path for kids to actually get out and \"do\" things rather than being passive screen consumers. \n\nMaybe if they're busy with the activities, rather than the endless documentation (model it parents!), they'll be able to say to their screen-obsessed peers that the joy and excitement is in the doing.  And perhaps they'll invite others to come along for the next experience, phone-free, to experience the joys of being and doing without social media's intrusion.\n\nI can just imagine the conversation, \"Oh, we're having too much fun to worry about the phone.  NO, we're not going to stop and take pictures.  You have to come try it, in person, to understand.  Leave your phone off, it just gets in the way.\"\n\nWhen we finally get to \"No one really cares, anyway.\" regarding social media generic content, we'll be making progress.",

        "Thank you for this warning Dr. Murthy. But I wonder, why only a warning for kids. Adults aren't faring much better on social media. With all due respect to The New York Times where I am writing this very comment, and where outrageous and uncivil comments are supposed to be removed, even here, the voices of anger and vitriol get through, even here, reading the comments has negative effects on my mental health. Even here, I feel the partisan rancor rising. \n\nWe need to have a deeper conversation about not just social media, but the move away from print culture to online culture and how this affects not just our individual mental health, but the health of the republic itself.

It is parents that are handing their kids smartphone.\n\n\nChildren and teens have little to no sense of risk. I'm fact, they, rightfully, have the opposite.  If anything, a stern warning will only encourage them to use SM. \n\n\nBut I suspect that it's the PRIVATE nature of SM that is corrosive.  I'm a large way, SM is a form of dark web, not from govt but parents.  The remedy, I think, is to force, by law,  all SM content visible by guardian.  Take the darkness of SM away from children.\n\nOf course children should be encouraged to have independence and even privacy but that should be reserved for real PHYSICAL space not cyber space.   Force kids to get out of the house in order to engage/talk/interact face-to-face with friends without snooping parents.",
        "I'm so glad to see this getting the focus it deserves.  One thing parents need to demand from the tech companies is much more robust controls over the devices they give their kids.  Apple screentime for example is a bad joke with so many flaws and work arounds intended to keep kids hooked, like a \"one more minute\" function that can't be disabled.  It should be law that parental controls have a simple interface that allows them to shut down a device's OS after a certain period of usage.  Start by giving parents the control that the tech-makers are deceitfully undermining.",

        "I do agree with Dr. Murthy especially as a grandmother who has seen the impact of parental restriction and no parental restriction surrounding social media. However, we need more than a Surgeon General Warning: Social Media causes vison destruction and psychological trauma to human beings under 18.\n\nHere is why: I have two kids who both have 2 kids each - I have 4 grandkids, aged 16-20. One set of grandkids had zero social media restrictions, and both have vision issues and will for lifetime need corrective lenses. Another set whose parents are IT executives restricted iPhones, electronics and social media until 9th grade. Yet, one of the restricted grandkids ended up with anorexia and body image issues (successfully treated). Each set of parents took different approaches and yet the outcome is 3 out of 4 will experience lifetime physical and emotional damage from their use of social media.  Bottom line: developing human beings are vulnerable to harm from social media, especially humans under 18.  Were the warnings about seat belts effective? No, we found out that when it comes to kids, we needed laws and penalties and the ability to litigate. What makes this dangerous situation any different?",

Kids are smarter than we so times give them credit for, and if we clearly delineate problems social media use might cause to their mental health, they just might start thinking about limiting their uses and the parents who consent to unbridled acess to social media might start putting time limits on it.

But nobody has been 'waiting' for information - Researchers have been exploring this link for over a decade and the evidence is not clear.
