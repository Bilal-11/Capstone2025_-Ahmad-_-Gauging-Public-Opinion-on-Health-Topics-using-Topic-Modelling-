        "I get what you are trying to say but YUCK!!\n\nAllow me to remind you about HIPAA for the next time you think about rifling through a patient's chart for anything that is not related to their care or for consented or IRB-approved research.   Sadly, many get sick and face their mortality at your age and younger, but it's not an invitation for you to determine how they might differ from you.\n\nI cannot think of anything more none of anyone's business than someone's health and to suggest that she should share more with the undeserving public is shameful.  Why don't you set an example for us all by putting all of your personal EHR records online, along with provider notes.  I look forward to seeing them.",
        "I don't sense that cancer diagnoses are stigmatized today. My wife was diagnosed with Stage 3C ovarian cancer in 2016. She endured a difficult first twelve months of treatment. She enjoyed twenty months of remission, and then it returned in January 2019, the same day my mother had a massive heart attack weeks before her death. \n\nI simply do not recall any stigmatization of her disease. We needed people's prayers and support, and she received them in abundance. I am happy to say, nearly eight years later, she has been in remission five years since that 2019 recurrence. Every month is a new gift. The treatments to get her here battered her. She will never be the same as 'before cancer'. That is one thing that people who have never dealt with cancer do not understand. \n\nIn time, we will know exactly what kind of cancer Princess Kate has. The fact the pathology found the cancer after surgery, and that she is receiving 'preventive' chemo, suggests it is a gynecological cancer that was caught early. We will pray that this is the case. Kate will never be the same either. But prayers and support are what she needs most from the rest of the world, not morbid curiosity.",
        "Like the doctor who broke the news to me on the phone? That was fun.",
        "I felt I was doing something good for myself and others when I shared news that I was undergoing radiation for breast cancer. My family and friends were on my team; they saw me manage the fatigue and my concern. They cheered me on as I became a long-term survivor. I think and hope I brought them some positive ways to deal with adversity if something like this ever happens to them.",
        "Thank you for this compassionate commentary. I haven\u2019t read the other comments, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re full of \u201cshe owes us!\u201d because she\u2019s a public figure, etc.  I understand your identifying with Catherine. She\u2019s the same age as my daughter, so I realize why I\u2019ve been so anxious for her.  Yes, sharing her experience may be helpful in the fight against cancer and perhaps she\u2019ll be able to do that eventually. But it\u2019s not up to the rabid public to force her. Especially not the Americans.",
        "Two years ago when I shared my cancer diagnosis with a few select friends and family members, their immediate responses ranged from, \"Well, I just had my annual checkup and got a clean bill of health!\" to \"So... How was your dad's trip to Europe?\" to \"Now you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life!\" \n\nIt took me a few days of feeling utterly unmoored to regaining my grip so I could keep showing up in my own life every day. \n(And, to be honest, the whirlwind of medical appointments was a welcome distraction from the ever-present fear.)\n\nWhich is all to say that I can see now how news of a potentially fatal illness hitting so close to home can turn some people into self-absorbed idiots. That's just the fact of it.\n\nFor the most part, I and my relationships have recovered but are forever changed, and that's a fact of cancer, too.",
        "A young cancer patient\u2019s thoughts: every time one of us steps forward, we raise awareness that no one is too young, too rich, too white, or too thin to get cancer. It comes for us all, basically, and we owe it to the next generation to stop more if not all cancers. The number of young women like me with breast cancer is so alarming, I sometimes can\u2019t sleep. I feel helpless. I am helpless. But knowing my loudness encourages others to get screenings makes me feel better. Like I\u2019m doing my part to help people. This has to end.",
        "I've now had 4 different cancers. 2 were stage 4 including acute leukemia. I'm cured. I'm fine. Cancer is overrated. Stop whining and live.",
        "I\u2019m 41 and I was diagnosed for stage 1 breast cancer in October.  I\u2019m now cancer free.  But I had no family history, no genetic reasons, no lifestyle reasons.  It was a complete shock for me and my family as a I\u2019d been a healthy, active mom of two kids.  I eat mostly plant based, exercise daily, meditate etc.  \nI told people sparingly.  My picks were those who were naturally positive, optimistic and supportive\u2014 in other words, NOT most people.  Of the people I HAD to tell (my husband\u2019s family and a couple people who would have wondered why I was MIA) I found their constant questioning a burden.  I had to repeatedly make THEM feel better with every test and treatment I disclosed.  If I was happy, some people treated me like I must be in denial and was even told \u2018you don\u2019t pretend to be strong\u2019.  And I believe at the root of the litany of questions was THEIR fear and them wanting to distance themselves from the possibility it could happen to them.  But guess what?  It can.  And it\u2019s good to know that!  Don\u2019t take life for granted.  But when you have cancer and someone is feigning sympathy in order to grill you for info to make themselves feel \u2018safer\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s the opposite of what you need in a challenging time.  That\u2019s why people with cancer don\u2019t want to tell you.",
        "There's a quote in The Sopranos where Junior Soprano is diagnosed with cancer and implores his nephew (Tony) to not tell anyone because \"When people know you're sick they treat you differently, like you're a non entity.\"\n\nSadly, there's a lot of truth to that.",
        "I would not advise telling anyone other than trusted caregivers about your cancer journey. My wife who had ALL learned this the hard way. After her diagnosis she quickly opted to go for hard core chemotherapy over a period of 9 months. The two of us spoke about it candidly with both friends and family and we began noticing people we thought had cared dropping out of our orbit. We were definitely being treated differently! \n\nUpon my wife going into remission things slowly returned to normal until 5 years later when she relapsed again. Then it happened all over again only it was worse. The majority of her friends just couldn't handle the prospect of her near-term demise and chose to disappear. \n\nIt was sad that they chose to do this because as I\u2019ve come to learn, many terminally ill cancer patients, (my wife being one) are their most beautiful when they surrender and live each day to its fullest. She was never a kinder, more loving, gentle person than she was the end, the final two years of her life.",
        "Facing this right now after a fresh cancer diagnosis which is early stage, no symptoms, likely no treatment in the near future. Do I tell people, mainly because it's on my mind and taking a lot of my attention and, honestly, because the science is cool? Do I spare folks to not cause unnecessary alarm? Or is it precisely in such cases that we should be open, in order to contribute to a dialogue in which cancer is not necessarily the worst thing?",
        "Doctors need to know their patients.  I would have been comfortable with a phone call--which sounds brash and unsupportive-- but I was called in to meet again with the Doc who read my mammogram.  The setting told me what I expected:  Comfortable chairs, box of tissues, two staff members present.  Doc spoke slowly about what was seen on the mammogram, then announced it was breast cancer. \n\nI think they were amazed I didn't break out in sobs.  I took the news calmly.\n\nWhen you don't get naked every night with a husband, it really doesn't matter if you're missing a breast......c'est la vie!",
        "I was 32 when diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and at that time my children were young. I wasn't faced with the incessant pressure for information like Kate, so I never mentioned the word \"cancer \" to my kids. Later though, because of critical genetic testing information, I did share it with my daughter and now my granddaughters.",
        "I wish the princess strength, peace, privacy, and healing.\n\nMy father was at death's door throughout my childhood.  Or so my parents told me; yet he lives today.  I was about the age of Prince George now when I started physically restraining my mum during her hysteric fits as medical workers tried to save him.  I lived in constant terror of my father's death. My mum assured me we would be \"done for\" when death came. I thought we might die too if he died.\n\nThe idea of parents \"protecting\" their children and caring to share a diagnosis in an \"appropriate\" way for their tender age is alien to me.  It sounds lovely and I am glad for these children and other children with caretakers who can maintain themselves in crisis.",
        "It is shameful how Princess Kate has been hounded by the press and made the subject of jokes and speculation. She has always conducted herself and carried out her royal duties with good humor, dignity and grace. She deserves nothing less than compassion and respect at this difficult time in her life. Please, everyone, leave her alone.",
        "As somebody recently retired, I am old enough to remember when PATIENTS had their cancer diagnosis withheld so they wouldn't lose hope. I also remember the AIDS crisis, when young people died of \"pneumonia\". We then shifted to the age of Betty Ford, and later Montel Williams (MS), and Michael J. Fox (Parkinson's Disease). We seem to have backslid into a new age of secrecy: Jamie Fox has not revealed his health issue a year after hospitalization, and Madonna similarly has not revealed details of her hospitalization for an \"infection\". \n\nCelebrities are certainly entitled to privacy, especially when it has no impact on the public (UNLIKE, say, Lloyd Austin, or professional athletes whose teams and fans follow their health issues closely). The price of celebrity is a certain amount of privacy loss, and each celebrity will have their own threshold. I only ask, isn't it better to control the dialogue vs allowing unending speculation?",
        "I was 28 when diagnosed with thyroid cancer. I am now in my 40s. I have never been declared NED but there isn't anything to treat. The evidence of disease is contained in my blood as a low amount of measurable tumor marker.\n\nI look back and I see how my being open with friends, family, and colleagues wasn't the right thing to do. Today, I am even taken aback at my earnestness and yes, naivete, that I thought doing so would help me be supported. The dysfunctional family that treated me like a second class citizen still did so. Some friends melted down over their own past traumas and discounted my experience. Others placed me, an atheist, on prayer lists at their churches or tried to give me unwelcome religious objects. The university I worked for later railroaded me out of my job by decreasing my workload to the point where I had little choice but to leave.\n\nA personality-disordered endocrinologist who see-sawed between supportive and condescending served as my \"care team.\"\n\nWhen the next cancer diagnosis for me comes knocking, and no doubt it will, I am already plotting how to keep it entirely to myself. It's better to face it alone when you've chosen it, rather than hope for support that never arrives.",
        "I was diagnosed with cancer three days before my wedding. DH and I told no one other than his mother, an RN who got me in to see a cancer surgeon the same day as my spa spray tan appointment. On our wedding day, she helped zip up my dress and ensure that it covered the biopsy bruise. While we were alone I whispered \"I'm scared\" and she hugged me. She was the only person at our wedding who knew what was going on because we refused to ruin our celebration by letting the news out and then having to deal with everybody's reactions and questions and unsolicited advice and looks of fear and pity. \n\nA few weeks later we made some very hard phone calls to family and friends.\n\nI feel for Catherine and appreciate the boundaries she tried to maintain.",
        "Getting a cancer diagnosis today is very different than it was a few decades ago. What type of cancer you have, the stage, the likelihood of spread, and the available treatments make a huge difference. Cancer is not one thing but dozens of different things.\n \nI have prostate cancer that is low level and unlikely to spread. It's just not something to worry about, so I hardly even think of it. I told people with a shrug. \n\nNo one yet knows anything about Kate's cancer, but it sounds like tissue was removed and now she's getting chemo to prevent spread. It may be no big deal at all, just like mine. \n\nIf Kate is in this situation, let's hope she doesn't spin this into a book about how brave she is. That would just continue to reinforce the misinformation about cancer being a death sentence, which is less and less likely to be true today.",
        "first hint of trouble - get tested",
        "Too many people in my life are struggling with cancer. I don't care what type, I just want it gone from their bodies. Instead of poking and prodding with too many questions, I always ask, what can I do? That's the most important question.",
        "My daughter visited me and cried in my arms when her lung cancer had spread all over her body.  She had complained about feeling unwell on doctor visits but until the lung cancer caused a sore to develop on her back which was removed and biopsied nobody did anything much to discover what was wrong.  Just a 50 year old woman complaining of being tired. But by that time it was all over her system and she was under treatment for a year before she died.",
        "I tend to think it is none of our business. Charles maybe due to his role. Catherine is not really in line and has ceremonial duties. Her husband has already lived through one public tragedy. Public figures outside of their roles have no responsibilities beyond that. They are entitled to privacy. Even Austin although he should have informed Biden and the national security apparatus. As for the rise in cancer in younger people why be surprised. We see the same in the rise in our companion animals. We use deadly chemicals and pesticides as a routine matter. People still spray Roundup. I was just talking to my Vet about this today as an aside to my dogs checkup. As it is the season here of little yellow flags on laws and in parks saying...Dangerous to Children and Animals.",
        "I wouldn't want to diminish the importance of cancer in persons under 50 but the coverage seems a bit out of proportion to the data.   The incidence rates of all cancers from 2010 to 1019 only rose from 100/100,000 to 103/.   Not trivial but not large either.  \n\nLikewise for all ages death rates from cancer have fallen remarkably in the last 30 years - by more the 30%.   While lung is the main factor still other sites are going down fast as well - breast, prostate and colon.   \n\nSomehow a lack of balance has entered the discussion.",
        "While trying to have children my fertility doctor was the one who had to simultaneously tell me that I would not be able to bear children because he found ovarian cancer. He was in tears, as was I. He saved my life. Unlike many others, I shared all parts of my cancer journey with everyone hoping to enlighten people on what getting cancer actually means to you and your family. All during my surgeries, chemo and recovery all I saw were loved ones leaning over me with eyes filled with dread, expecting the worst, as 37 years ago ovarian cancer had a survival rate of 5%. I survived as did they but we are all marked by the experience. To many, I became the \"go to\" person when someone they knew was diagnosed with cancer. While not an expert, I could explain that the cancer person would be running a marathon, and we loved ones and family members would be on the sidelines cheering them on, offering them love, sustenance and maybe a space blanket, but that would be all we could do.",
        "My husband had a heart attack 20 years ago.  There was no question of keeping it secret, because he was a key figure in our community who had to show up at designated places and times.  There was an outpouring of kindness, but there was also a ton of unsolicited advice and lots of nosy questions.  The worst was running into people in the grocery store and having them give me sad looks for months afterwards.  My friend who was in the same position as my husband and had colon cancer calls it \"cancer face.\" \n\nAfter my husband retired, he was diagnosed with a very early stage of bladder cancer.  He underwent treatment for months and we didn't tell anyone except our immediate family.  It was a lot better that way.",
        "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer 15 years ago.  Only my wife knows.\n\nAlthough it metastised 10 years ago, it hasn't interrupted my life. Three years ago, I started therapy. So far, so good.",
        "Catherine is part of the embodiment of the United Kingdom and it\u2019s substantially reduced other dominions.  She is not a private citizen.  She doesn\u2019t have a right to deceive her knowledgeable subjects who recognize codswallop when it is forced upon them.\n\nIf controlling when her children learned what was going on was the most important, then she needed to make the effort to show up at a suitable array of events.\n\nKeep in mind that lots of people do get chemo and go to work the next day.  They wear wigs, and they do their jobs, lest they lose them.\n\nKate can\u2019t have it both ways.  No glory without the guts.",
        "It's even harder for Oncologists to tell patients that their treatment is failing and death is imminent so they let Hospitalists and ICU doctors do that for them.",
        "They can do what I and others have done: Keep it to yourself. Continue life normally.",
        "We decided to share details with people close to my wife and me.  Those people would notice something is wrong, and would find out eventually.  They would be hurt if we hadn't shared, and we saw it as an educational journey we could share with those interested.  We did not broadcast it to people who didn't need to know.  Everyone in the world may know who Catherine is, but few actually know her or she them.  She should do as she wishes and what gives her strength and focus for the fight.",
        "It\u2019s hard disclosing you have a serious mental illness too. This comes up when applying for jobs and having to explain long gaps in a resume. It comes up in dating when a prospect fears someone with schizoaffective spectrum disorder. It comes up in social situations and at get togethers. There is great stigma when it comes to illness. Roger Ebert once said that Americans are conditioned to hide our illnesses. We were one of the happiest nations according to the World Happiness Report, but we\u2019re out of the top 20 now. Ever since Galen and before him, people have tried to help the sick and injured. Margaret Mead said the first sign of civilization was the discovery of a skeleton from prehistory with a splint on their leg; they weren\u2019t left behind.\n\nRoger Ebert again: \"Kindness covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn\u2019t always know this and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.\"",
        "I am in treatment for invasive breast cancer.  I believe the only thing worse would be going through treatment and worrying how you would pay for  the lifesaving medical services.  Thankfully, neither I not Kate had that worry.  She may not have the responsibility, but she has an extraordinary opportunity to save lives by telling more about her diagnosis and treatment.  \"Save one life, save the world.\"",
        "Thank you for a well written and sensitive essay\\opinion.  We all know that cancer of any kind is a frightening diagnosis.  If someone is diagnosed with a serious illness, they must make the decision to whom, and with how many people they wish to share that medical information. Certainly, it would seem such information would be shared with one's close family - although, as other people have mentioned, timing can be an issue to be considered when disclosing a serious illness or disease to other family members and close friends. But because one is considered a \"public person\" - a phrase that could describe the Princess of Wales, Secretary of Defense Austin or a well known television or film actor, for that matter - placement within that broad category does NOT necessarily mean that an individual has waived all his\\her privacy rights, and is required to broadcast all their intimate medical details to the general public at large.  Certainly, many people with cancer have said that they did not share their diagnosis with many others, because they did not want to be primarily defined by their disease.  We all deal with things differently, and how we cope with and manage illness and disease can change throughout our lives. So ... compassion and empathy can go a long way, as we make our way on this journey - which none of us is going to get out of alive.  So, be kind.",
        "OMG,  yes, she seems like a nice enough person. And she has a family. And I have absolutely no reason not to wish her well. \n\nBut no, I really don't need to know EVERYTHING about her life. And even if she did decide to disclose further medical details, what the heck would I do with the information?\n\nAll this seems to be driven by the media who have to have something to fill the pages between the ads, or empty pauses between the commercials. \n\nNo, I absolutely do not \"need\" to know any more details. \n\nI hope everything goes well. Good luck and all that.",
        "Well said doc.",
        "My goodness, I am in month 26 of cancer treatment. After the shock of the diagnosis, the first people I turned to were family and close friends. For months I wasn\u2019t in any shape to tell a large group of people, much less a nation, about what I was going through. I can\u2019t even imagine.",

        "One of the least discussed issues with a cancer diagnosis is the possibility, as a woman, your husband may leave you. It would seem, from what I\u2019ve heard, that men believe that the \u201cworse\u201d in their vows only applies to them. Many women know that when a relative or friend becomes ill it is the women, in her life, that shore her up and are there for her.",
        "Everyone lives in a goldfish bowl. Withholding information about a medical diagnosis that affects the lives of others can be viewed as attempting to manage the news. Perhaps the good way to release traumatic information is slowly, allowing others to adjust to the consequences.",

        "As a breast cancer survivor treated at City of Hope, I share the opinion that making a diagnosis public might help to support and inform others facing the same condition. I was very open with my diagnosis and treatment and can only hope that it might have helped someone further down the line. \n\nMy mother died of colon cancer decades ago, shrouded in secrecy. I do not have Lynch Syndrome, but have had an issue with a colon polyp for which I was recommended to have a resection. Again, thanks to City of Hope to whom I turned again, I was able to have an alternative and completely successful procedure. I tell everyone this story as well.\n\nI see all of this as paying it forward for the care and knowledge I have accessed.\n\nHowever, I completely  understand the need for privacy or the difficulty faced by those with a cancer diagnosis and respect their right to only disclose what, if anything, that they are comfortable with discussing.",
        "When my husband was diagnosed with terminal state 4 cancer of the esophagus, it fell to me to share the news, which was shocking and emotionally overwhelming. For a while, I told him that he had to tell his sister and her family; but he never could. I eventually made the call. I told my family and ended up telling our friends by email, because I couldn't imagine making that call over and over again.  Over time, I shared his diagnosis on Facebook because I wanted people to know something of the disease and to seek treatment sooner rather than later.  It's an excruciatingly hard choice and there is no right answer.",
        "Well, one good way to go public is NOT TO LIE ABOUT IT! She told the world it was not cancer. There's no doubt that within a few days of the surgery, she knew cancer was found. For more than a month, she allowed the world to think it was not cancer -- when she knew it was. Why is is \"so brave\" of her now to disclose what she should have told everyone weeks ago? \nThe Royals are nothing but public puppets. If she doesn't want to be under the microscope, she can always step down, step aside, get out -- like Harry and Megan did.",
        "I'm 77. In 2021 I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. My first instinct, and I think it's a common one, was to not say anything to anyone except my husband. Telling makes it real. But I did tell my close family  and friends and Im glad I did. Their concern and support helped me through a scary time.The tumor was removed, I had chemo, and so far, so good. O TOH I have a good friend who only told two people about her breast cancer diagnosis. Did not tell mother or brother. To each his own.",

        "You want a group of diseases that have a stigma attached to revealing you have one of them, cancer takes a back seat to mental disorders.\n\nBeing treated for a mental disorder is still largely considered a no-no for anyone wishing a career in public life such as politics.  Being treated for cancer is no such prohibition. \n\nYeah, I know that treating cancer is easier than treating mental disorders.  Except that isn't true despite anti-psychiatry people claiming all psychiatric medications do is turn people into zombies or as presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. claims turns people into mass murderers.",
        "My husband(now deceased) and I both had cancer.  We tried to keep our journeys somewhat private.  In my case, it was largely because my family of origin just isn't supportive in a way that is helpful.\n\nWith both of our journeys there is so much misinformation people want to pass on to you.  Saying if only you had adopted a certain diet or taken a certain supplement you would be healthy.  It is especially cruel to say those things once one has a terminal cancer diagnosis.",
        "Everyone\u2019s cancer journey is different, and Kate and those close to her will need to decide how to navigate her journey. When I was diagnosed with advanced throat cancer in my 40s, my wife and I decided to let our close friends and family know. We used a free site called CaringBridge.org to publish regular updates to those we granted permission. In practice, that meant many friends and extended family could keep up with our journey and offer kind and touching words of support. \n\nIn the end, that decision was more helpful to us than we could have imagined. We didn\u2019t have to spend time calling and texting people with updates. My family and I didn\u2019t have to start every conversation by talking about how things are going. In addition, friend and neighbors wanted to pitch in and help - from bringing meals 2x per week, to driving me to treatments, to taking on things like landscaping and home repair that we didn\u2019t have the energy to do. And there were a few times during treatments when I was feeling low and was able to ask my community for encouragement. \n\nI offer my story as a way to help people navigate their own cancer journeys. I think many people react to a serious diagnosis with an instinct for privacy. But letting a large circle of friends and family in on the journey can be more beneficial than you might think.",
        "I was very close to my cousin, who died of cancer in his early 60s. He told my mother (who is his first cousin) and other relatives about his diagnosis right away, but he never told me. My mother informed me but said I shouldn\u2019t reach out to him until I heard from him directly. When I finally did hear from him, months later, it was to tell me by email how hurt and angry he was that I never reached out to him as he was fighting for his life. I replied that \u201cMom told me not reach out until you did, and you never did\u201d. I share this story to demonstrate that all this secrecy can backfire big time.",
        "The incessant talk about cancer these days (due to Kate Middleton's diagnosis and the finding that under 50s are now facing more cases) is fairly terrifying to hypochondriacs and otherwise normal people like me, with no history of cancer.\n\nAt the same time I see no reduction in the number of people drinking (alcohol is a known carcinogen), smoking (whether it's weed or not, it's bad for you over the long term) or otherwise eating unhealthy processed foods. Everyone wants to avoid cancer, but like everyone who wants to go to heaven without dying, a large segment of the public doesn't do anything to mitigate their risks.",
        "When you tell people you have cancer, they respond in different ways\n This can be stressful when you have limited energy to do much more than deal with your therapy and close family.

        "As a cancer survivor, Kate Middleton's news brought up a lot of feelings and memories.\n\nAs Dr. Lamas so clearly articulates, newly diagnosed cancer patients are reeling with fear and uncertainty.   Sharing the news feels like another insurmountable mountain.  \n\nI personally shared the news with a close circle at first, and then gradually shared with a wider group. As a result, about 20 people scheduled a colonoscopy as a result of my sharing my diagnosis.   One individual had a pre-cancer polyp removed as a result. \n\nI agree with Dr. Lamas that the shame and stigma of cancer prevents the sharing of knowledge about medical history and risks in families.",
        "I was recently diagnosed with cancer.  I could not bring myself to tell anyone -- not even my husband -- for several weeks.  It was very confusing and hurtful to the people I love, my husband in particular.  I have tried to explain, with limited success that it was, indeed, like the telling would make it real. That once others knew, nothing would be the same. That there would be a no-going-back, \"before\" and \"after\", not so much about the diagnosis, but the diagnosis being *known*.  All conversations would change. They would look at me differently. And they would need my support to assuage their fears, which I couldn't imagine giving in those first weeks when I was just trying not to fall apart.  \n\nSo I didn't tell them for a long while. I feel badly, but I don't regret it because guess what? Everything did change.  Not for the worse -- I have never felt more love and support than I ever have now -- but there is no doubt that nothing will be the same.",
        "I was diagnosed with cancer at age 55, a little more than 10 years ago. It was an ER doctor who told me I had cancer in a straightforward way. It took her a few minutes and then she walked away, moving on to her next patient.\n\nI did not have time to think about the fact that I had cancer. I had emergency surgery to remove the tumour and then prep for chemo and chemo itself. It was all like one long dream, but not a good one.\n\nOne of the things I remember is one of the chemo nurses telling me  rather matter-of-factly, that she was seeing more younger people diagnosed with cancer. In their 20s and 30s.\n\nIt might have a lot to do with our toxic and polluted environment, which affects the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. I do not have the numbers, but I suspect that cancers are on the increase.",
        "When I was diagnosed with cancer twelve years ago, I made a point of immediately telling all manner of family, friends, and colleagues about my bad news. This not only informed them of what my wife and I were up against, but, above all, expressly gave them my permission to openly support me. And did they ever. Some were so supportive and in such unexpected ways, I came to see them as angels without wings, walking the earth. A cancer diagnosis should never be a shameful secret.",

Underneath it all, fear drives people to blame the patient, and while family members will deny blaming, their questions have a clear undertone:  I don't accept that you've handled this well, because if you had, you wouldn't be dying, and that's what we can't accept.\n\nThen there are the well-meaning neighbors, testing you to see if you are doing it the right way.\n\nThen the co-workers.\n\nSurely the author has seen the dark side of the desperate hope and toxic positivity of struggling to process bad medical news.",

I am now, 8 years later, living with stage 4 cancer, and my family and good friends are aware.  But, I'm much less overt.  I really don't want to be judged or treated differently.  I don't want my life and opportunities to be defined by cancer.  I want to live as much as possible now as my life will be shorter than most.   But sometimes I need to share, and that's fine too.

        "I was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 55, during a time of great family and workplace stressors. (I attribute the cancer to those stresses, and to a desk job with too much sitting -- there was no family history of this disease at all.) \n\nI told my siblings and spouse immediately -- the former for my comfort, the latter out of respect and alerting them to my need for support. Not until a firmer diagnosis and treatment plan was in place did I inform my teenage children, parents, immediate work colleagues, and select circle of friends. This allowed me to control those conversations, and to present the forward-looking plan along with the shocking news -- because the last thing I needed was to have to manage the emotions and well-meaning sympathies of so many other people, in addition to my own fear and the challenge of deciding on treatment. All who were informed respected my instructions to keep the news confidential. \n\nFortunately the cancer was caught early, surgery took care of it with no chemo, and eight years later I am in excellent health. But for certain, deciding who needs to know is a deeply personal decision that no one else has a right to make.",

If pathology during the operation shows no presence of cancer, is chemo or other treatment necessary, given the potential side effects.  \n\nI recently had facial surgery for an aggressive skin cancer called spindle cell sarcoma.  Pathology showed the surgeon\ngot it all.  It was recommended that I start radiation after a month of healing to make sure that there were no residual\ncells.

She passed away three weeks later. I had to call family and friends to let them know she was near the end - she had not shared with anyone. She was a private person. I was upset and angry about her choice, which denied me the opportunity to spend more time with her.

With his family devastated and grieving, it didn't feel right to add to their burden with my news.  I chose then to tell only close friends individually, by phone or in-person. No Facebook posts or general discussion at work (though I told my boss, of course.) And I spoke with a therapist. A week before my surgery, my husband and I shared the news with my in-laws. Post-successful-surgery (fortunately, my cancer hadn't spread) I told a few people at work, in part because I couldn't go in the office for a few weeks. I'm glad this is all behind me.

They were clearly repulsed by the disease and what I was going through. They didn't want to hear about it, didn't want to know. \nWhat they REALLY wanted to know was that THEY did not probably have the genes we currently associate with cancer. When my test came back that the genes we know of NOW that cause cancer were not in me, they scattered like the seeds on a dried out dandelion. \nAnd not another word has been said on their side about what I went through in that most horrific year of 2020.

An example from my own experience; there are 350 known lung cancers. Which one did I have? Even then if you know its name you're not the oncologist who will treat it. Chemo treatments are not prepackaged and just distributed to the patient.  In chemo everyday you show up for treatment your blood is drawn and tested. Your height and weight is determined and then the chemicals that will be infused are custom mixed by an onsite pharmacist. Some days during the treatment you may be sent home instead of being treated because your blood cells aren't well enough for another treatment. Then you start again a week later. This can go on for multiple months until the oncologist says they can't give you anymore treatments because it could kill you!  Once the treatment is over you are left to hope that it worked and have years to wait to see if it actually did. It becomes a job for the person going through it.",

        "An acquaintance, bordering  on friend had cancer that she eventually died of.  She kept it a secret from most people, forcing her husband to to lie to others for her. Also it deprived him, a care giver, the support he might have needed while she was sick.  A year and half after her death my husband was diagnosed with cancer (his more treatable) and I told him we are not keeping this a secret which would be his default.   He responded, \"I'm not putting this on Facebook.\"  I said, \"Of course not. I mean we are telling our friends and family because I'm not dealing with this alone.\"  \nMy husband survived his surgery and seems cancer free.  I was glad he and I were able to talk about it with friends and family and get support.  \nI get that if you are sick it's about you and getting better. But there are people out there who love you and care about you - let them.",
        "Having had cancer, I feel for the mother in the article who didn't want to tell her sons. It is profound how far we can be compelled to go to remain the same in the eyes of our loved ones. How deeply (and unknowingly) we depend on the roles we play in our community for our sense of stability, \n\nWhen I first got my breast cancer diagnosis in 2020 at age 50, my mother (who also had BC around that age) said: don't tell anyone. She had faced months and months of the sad eyes, the inability of her friends and neighbors to not pity her. Cancer treatment has improved a lot (drugs for nausea, i.e.), so there may be less of that now. \n\nI didn't actively follow her advice, but in the end, I didn't tell many but family and close friends. It felt supportive to be in social spaces (which were all on Zoom) where being a cancer patient was not my identity, and I could feel like my old self, someone in addition to a person battling cancer.  In retrospect, I wonder what it would have been like if I had been more open about it. But as others have said, we are all different and respond doing the best we can.",

And then after 'the discussion', everyone is crying, but on the same page, and on their way to healing the pain and sadness while the patient can still hear the love they have for each other.  It is such a hard position to be in for families, how many times I cried right along with them....sigh",

Of course I was petrified when I received the diagnosis over a year ago but I researched my treatment options and my right to try complementary medicine that included nutraceuticals with a substantial scientific backing. As I have said before, despite all the research on cancer prevention and treatment in the scientific literature; there is no standard of cancer care that will work against all cancers and for all the people with a cancer diagnosis. Treatment has to be customized for each individual cancer patient and nothing short of throwing the kitchen sink should be done to try to destroy every cancer cell in body and to be cancer free. \n\nA person with systematic training in doing research could always have a potential to conquer even the worst cancers considered as incurable.

        "I was diagnosed in my mid-40\u2019s with a cancer I was too young to have. I told exactly 2 people. In the age where some choose to livestream their surgical procedures and update followers on social media this desire for privacy might seem old-fashioned. But I needed time to wrap my head around it, accept it and deal with it on my own terms first. I was also too sad to manage other people\u2019s sadness. I\u2019m extremely grateful to wear the label of a cancer survivor now, but 5 years ago even to attach the word cancer with my identity was unbearable. I had prided in myself for being fit and healthy until that point. It took me a couple of years to say the word without choking up. I can\u2019t imagine going through it under the microscope of the entire world. When her health issues were first announced in vague terms with an extended absence I\u2019m sure many people with a serious medical history understood in some visceral way the implications. On a human level I just feel bad that she was forced into disclosing probably the hardest thing she now has to accept about herself and her body with the world, not to mention the agony of knowing that the news will find her young children one way or another.",

Twenty years ago I found a sizable cancer chat group. Finding another person with the same cancer was very helpful.",

I also think it is OK to acknowledge that the Princess will not have to face drowning in medical debt or be forced to make choices based on cost and she is unlikely to face prescription drug shortages.

        "Does Princess Catherine, a prominent member of the British royal family and wife of the heir to the throne, have a \"right\" to keep the information on her illness private?  That's debatable, but there is a legitimate news interest in the details of her cancer that all news organizations should want to pursue. It is the same, I should add, with the King's illness and treatment. There is a difference between that and the petty gossip-mongering about the Royal family that I've seen in the British tabloids.  These people constitute the unelected ruling family of the United Kingdom, and as such have lost a right to privacy when it concerns issues that can effect their status in the country.",

Nevertheless, I was so fortunate to be able to take a 6-month paid medical leave to have my treatment, and with everyone\u2019s good wishes. During it, I wasn\u2019t forgotten; colleagues sent me baskets of fun (coloring books and crayons, jigsaw and crossword puzzles and a gift card from Barnes & Noble) that certainly lifted my spirits. At the end of my leave, I drove into work to start at 7 a.m., well before my colleagues would show up at 8 or 9. They knew I\u2019d be back that day, so the day before put up balloons in my work area and a big white poster signed by members of my work unit, welcoming me back. I still have it, years later.

I'd rather focus on health and healing, good food and exercise. I write a weekly Caring Bridge blog sharing my medical updates but mostly I write about my thoughts of life and mortality, and what I'm learning in this unwanted but still incredibly rich stage of life. The supportive comments on my blog, and the outreach to me from all the wonderful people I've known from all corners of my life, have been truly incredible and brighten my every day as I deal with the challenges of treatment, side effects and my confronting the inevitable day when this life will end and the next will begin.

I mean, I had prostate cancer 20 years ago, had surgery for it and no signs of recurrence since. There, I said it. Wooo (spooky music).  I know no one is interested, because I'm not famous or anything, but the point is, it doesn't bother me one bit to mention it. Of course, no one's being interested is a perfectly good reason not to bring something up. And at my age, get togethers w old friends too often devolve into an \"organ recital\" of medical woes. But why feel, what, shame? embarrassment?  Maybe it's a genetic relic from millennia past in the savannahs, where nobody in the tribe wanted to be perceived as the weak one, a better target for the predators. Sure, \"I don't want to talk about my cancer because it makes me feel sad and upset\" is fine. So say that.  But I don't get the \"hide my weakness from the wolves\" reflex.

        "Revealing one's health issues is a personal decision that should be respected whatever the decision is based on and whether sensible or not.\n\nIn the case of my wife's diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, it happened days before we were scheduled to attend a wedding of family friend as well as a major family get together, neither of which we attended because we were awaiting a confirming diagnosis and appointments with doctors at another hospital more well known as having a specialty in pancreatic cancer treatment (Johns Hopkins). So, lots of people knew right from the start.\n\nTwo things happened immediately after the diagnosis. First, my wife and I dove into the subject of pancreatic cancer treatment and research publications on the disease. Secondly, we started getting a lot of emails from friends and family, some just expressions of love and hope and others that seemed to come out of the QAnon realm.\n\nMy wife and I talked about how to respond to the emails and I offered to write the responses and focus them on both her condition and the science behind her treatments. We were in clinical trials from the start and she went on to enroll in a total of four trials and lived for 31 months.\n\nVirtually all of those we had contact with appreciated our informative emails and the whacky emails to us ceased.

Before I even started chemo I had to sit down with 160 teenagers and talk to them about my diagnosis.  To take on a public role means to trade some privacy for some empowerment, and the more public the role the bigger the tradeoff.  \n\nThis most terrifying conversation became my most meaningful one, as I opened up to questions that no one but teenagers dared ask.\n\nHow did you know you had to go to the doctor?\nHow did you tell your parents you have cancer?\nHow does chemotherapy work?\nAre you afraid of dying?\n\nI welcomed questions and shared my experiences through 16 rounds of chemo, major surgery, radiation, and a year of immunotherapy. Students cut my hair before it fell out, wore masks after they were no longer required, brought me treats and recorded encouraging videos. These conversations were life-changing for some students, and perhaps life-saving down the line if they know how to talk about cancer with doctors and family.\n\nKate is entitled to as much privacy as she can manage to keep, but I'd ask her to consider everything her public leadership could mean--including to herself.",
        "Perhaps the best medical advice I've ever received was from a urologist in New York who diagnosed me with prostate cancer and recommended I investigate the several treatment options  on my own before deciding on the best course of action. I readily took him up on it and interviewed a half-dozen specialists around town. I dined out on these encounters with friends, describing the specialists' various personality quirks and their helpfulness or lack thereof. My male friends were a particularly keen audience - one asked, \"What do women do about their prostate?\" The experience was strangely exhilarating, enabling me to \"own\" the disease and become, in effect, its master rather than its victim.",

We humans, akin to our cousins the apes, are curious animals, and want to know what's going on, even if for no reason but 'chit-chat' to entertain, or instruct us, in what may lay around the corner, a malignant tumor brewing within, perhaps still with no symptoms, but growing nevertheless. Eventually, by having periodic checks of our body, DNA, family history, and of course symptoms and signs becoming obvious, cancer remains a scary presence in need of action...and hope there is adequate treatment to cure or at least control it, and allow not only our survival but ability to enjoy life, short as it may be.

My concerns were the community around my family and especially my child, but more than that, the fact that I am self-employed and I feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that if news got out, I would have difficulty finding work. We told people in our local community and, of course, family, but I chose to keep it quiet in my larger work setting to the extent possible. We also had to deal with drama queens who LOVE to focus on someone else's misfortune, as well as an older relative with dementia, with whom we chose to share only a limited amount of information.

When you have cancer you lose your hair, your fingernails and toenails, your taste buds, your energy, and some parts of your body.

They removed some in particular that were causing the worst pain that required a day or two in the hospital and I was diagnosed with lymphoma and an oncologist ordered some more tests and a chemo schedule.  Unbeknownst my nosy friend who was another teacher from school must have spoken to my wife while I was out so when I returned back to work at school a few days later on the following Monday morning everyone there already knew so I didn't have to say a word about it to anyone.

Can I afford this long term?\n\nUnlike royalty, no.\n\nAs for family, I told those who by practicality had to know, and the rest I didn't worry about. I had no choice with my job - this was China, and I was lucky the insurance lasted after I was let go (though in China you have to pay cash up front aned THEN you are hopefully reimbursed).\n\nI suspect most are the same: their main concerns are first physical survival and then financial survival.

        "When I had cancer, I had the opposite take (but yeah, I\u2019m not a princess). I was annoyed at how the word scared people so much they could barely talk to me at times. I wanted to say the word as often as possible, and as matter-of-factly as possible, to destigmatize it. Having taken care of many people with heart failure, a disease that frankly has a worse prognosis then many cancers, part of my annoyance was simply that  people are so inexplicably, afraid of the word, cancer, and yet not the words of other just as devastating diagnosis words.\n\nAlso, I read the Metaphor of Illness many years ago. Susan Sontag\u2019s take on the cultural response to disease is enlightening and interesting. I think the response to cancer has improved since she wrote that, but not entirely. I won\u2019t say what cultural strangeness she highlights around how people treat those with cancer, so that you go read it.",
        "I was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago and didn't want to talk about it with anyone other than a select few (3 people). It's tough talking about something that may kill you without breaking down - think about how that would look in a professional setting (although I did inform my boss immediately).\n\nAfter some time, I opened up more. I found that the conversation made some others uncomfortable to the point they would avoid talking to me assuming I was going to weep all over them I guess.\n\nIt was nearly 2 years before I told my own mom - didn't want to worry her as I was one of the lucky ones with a milder case.\n\nUnless you've walked in a cancer patient's shoes, don't judge them too harshly.",
        "I think she does have a responsibility to share because she is not just a wife and mother, she is also a princess to an entire nation whose future in some way rests on her shoulders.",
        "It\u2019s not quite the same thing to tell friends and family as it is to tell strangers worldwide who think they have a right to your personal information.",
        "CBS did not need to air the princess\u2019s remarks over FAU-Northwestern crunch time",
        "Doctors paly a very real role in handling this.  I spend time on the phone being yelled at by my mother's doctor - \"We can beat this!!!\" over and over like it was some personal affront that she'd decided on hospice. Maybe it was, and maybe doctors need more training on letting go of their egos and listening to their patients.\n\nOr perhaps just reading, in the era before everything was in theory available via computer records. (No, I do not believe this is necessarily an improvement, as I explain my own conditions over and over - they are well documented in the records that now doctors have no time to read.  Thanks Care Denial Industry!) \n\nHe and the hospital had repeatedly missed the incurable, untreatable leukemia noted clearly on the chart hanging on her bed.  For days, maybe as much as a week. So they kept her in the hospital to \"treat\" the white blood cell problem. I'm sure Medicare paid handsomely for those unnecessary days.\n\nThe medical communities, and especially doctors with God complexes, frame how the rest of us deal with news like cancers.  None of us gets out alive.  Help us understand the reality and the options.\n\nAnd ditch for-profit healthcare.",
        "So much of what we do, say, behave is fear driven.  She is afraid! And so are her loved ones.  Speaking out is educating. We all can learn. But for me, personally, \nspeaking out is just so difficult.",
        "I'm not a celebrity, but I didn't keep my diagnosis private. Overgeneralization.",
        "Jane Austen said it best: \"Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be.\"",
        "None of us can know \u2014 not even the Princess of Wales and her publicists \u2014 all of the impacts of our choices in what medical information we share in such situations.\n\nNot until 6 months into many rounds of chemotherapy and major surgery did I learn that at that the moment my boss spoke to HR about my diagnosis that a clock began ticking, giving me 6 months medical leave and continued medical insurance, which was then at an end. \nI still had 6 more rounds of chemotherapy to go. \n\nI later learned of a colleague who had kept her own diagnosis secret a couple of years earlier. She was not thinking about \u2014 nor did she know of \u2014 continuing paychecks or insurance benefits.",
        "Illness need not be a public matter.  While I have empathy for the princess,  I do not understand why the news media feel the need to give her and her condition so much space and time. She is not more human than anyone else.",
        "One of the very few pieces that goes sensitively and in a balanced fashion about this issue.  Thank you.",
        "Maybe Kate Middleton wants to keep it private until she and her family have had time to think about what is happening to her.  Sometimes we need to think things through with our loved ones first.  And she has every right to do that.  Wishing her good health and kindness.",
        "When I practiced, I often did a quick double take when someone with a bad disease was my age. I was a columnist for the local medical society, and one time one of these unfortunate stories prompted a column entitled, \"I have no problems,\" because in the face of what that individual was going through, my daily trials were really insignificant.",
        "Gee, I wish the media would leave that poor woman alone.  She has to deal with that dreaded disease and with a young family.  Yes, I know she and the family will be well taken care of due to their status.  However, enough is enough, from the harping on the doctored picture to her public conversation that must have been hard to do.  There is no more red meat for the press, she now has to settle down and deal what all people have to deal with to battle the disease and frankly, it's no one else's business.",
        "For better or worse, Catherine made a deal with the devil in marrying into one of the most public jobs on earth.  So, she should have thought about her privacy years ago, and she should have the best help in controlling her narrative.  My experience is that the best way to control is to come forward quickly and set the rules about information.  There is a huge opportunity lost here:  to teach, to reassure, and to support a stressed medical establishment in the UK.  It would be superb for her to have treatment in a NHS hospital, where she could be among everyone else, where she could improve the morale of all others providing care and receiving it.  She could enlist her key physicians to help her teach about her problem.  A key point is to explain how in medicine, there are aspects that are known, and those that are unknown, and how people must learn to handle the unknowns.   The same considerations go for Charles, whose mystery does no good for his country.",
        "I applaud a physician who shows such empathy and honesty when writing about a disease that she tries to cure on a daily basis. It seems to me that the reluctance of patients to share the news/details of their illness comes, at least, from two factors:\n1) sharing the news forces them to face the fact that, indeed, they have a very dangerous condition. \n2) too many people react to such news with all too visible pessimistic concern, some using the inaccurate and unfair metaphor of a \u201cfight\u201d against the disease (when they don\u2019t go into blaming the patient for past lifestyle issues that make her feel responsible for becoming ill). While it is entirely possible that psychology might play some role in assisting healing, it is grossly unfair to make the patient feel that, if his condition worsens, he is a \u201closer\u201d in this \u201cfight\u201d.",
        "Thank you so much for this touching piece. No one should have to share such a personal piece of information unless and until they are ready.\n\nSadly, we humans have been pouring industrial poisons into the air, water, land, for many decades. My guess is that this is, at least in part, responsible for the uptick in many devastating illnesses. There's also the \"luck of the draw\" piece. And our genetics. It's complicated.",
        "A month before the lockdown I was diagnosed with two cerebral aneurysms. My surgery scheduled for April was put on hold because of the lockdown. It finally occurred in early June of that yesr. The entire time I never told my adult son because I did not want him to live with the stress of my condition. Telling him about my condition was the hardest thing I have ever done. All these thoughts returned to me four years later when I thought about Katherine having to share the news with her three children because people on the internet cannot stop focusing on other people\u2019s lives. Sad!",
        "Had to watch my late wife and now my partner navigate this tough decision. Had my own scare with dysplasia. The three of us took different approaches. Each was the right choice.\nLike much else in life; one size does not fit all."
