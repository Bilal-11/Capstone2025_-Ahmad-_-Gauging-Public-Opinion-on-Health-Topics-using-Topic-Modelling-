        "These days going to the doctor for check ups is just a review if tests, and the taking of new tests",
        "NYT just ran an article about how for many older people (and their caregivers/drivers) multiple medical appointments are a huge time drain. If even half of those routine check ins could be televisits imagine all the savings of time and energy, lost work for caregivers, etc.",
        "I couldn\u2019t disagree more.  Telehealth visits are so impersonal a robocall might be able to handle it.  There is so much to an office visit then just the diagnosis.  How patient dresses in itself tells me a ton not to mention susing out hypochondria and secondary gain.  How many times i figured someone had something serious on the last sentence they uttered. \u201cOh yeah by the way\u2026\u201d",
        "As a mother, who has booked telehealth appointments at the behest of our pediatrician, I do not recommend this form of appointment. It\u2019s a twofold problem: same price as an in-person appointment and the diagnosis is usually \u201clet\u2019s meet in person, unless you prefer the antibiotics now.\u201d I end up paying for two appointments and the in-person diagnosis is usually never to take the antibiotics. Telehealth is as impersonal as healthcare can be. It seems like insurance is courting this type of appointment. Corporate medical care is the problem and technology exasperates it.",
        "There is a time and place for telehealth appointments and times when it should not be used. Video conferencing should be treated as a useful tool that has limits and if the situation is not going to fit within those limits, the doctor needs to use a different tool, such as an in-person visit. I personally would avoid any doctor that I see regularly that is 100% tele-health. But on the other hand if I just tested positive for Covid and want a script for Paxlovid, why not do it with tele-health and save us both time and added risk? But those are one-offs, on a case-by-case basis.",
        "Doc of 40 years here.  Telemedicine had its place during covid lockdown, but nothing replaces the human interface with a patient, and a clinical examination.  I have the luxury of spending as much time as I need with a patient, and listening to their story.  The old adage is, if you let them talk long enough, they give you the diagnosis.  And, a hands on, clinical exam is key. Many times, a patient will say they haven\u2019t been examined in such a way, which equates to no one really looked.  I am on the precipice of retirement, but now feel that I too will have to slog through a relatively marginal system for decent health care in my old age.  Believe me, from the inside vantage point, medicine in America is a mess.",
        "As a retired internist who has not worked with telemedicine, I wonder why it took telemedicine to teach this physician to focus on his patient.  (Really focus). \n\nI also am struck by the number of times I asked patents things like \"how long has your heart been racing?\" and received the answer \"?racing?\".  How many times I asked \"how long has that funny thing on your skin been there?\"  How many times I asked \"has anyone ever told you that you have a heart murmur?\"  How many times I said \"I see a new spot on your back we need to check\".  \n\nThe vast majority of medicine is talking to our patients.  Telemedicine is fine for that.  Still, a significant portion is by using our eyes, ears, fingers, and even smell.  This portion should not be abandoned.\n\nLastly, when my physician offers a warm handshake or a pat on the shoulder, there is real reassurance that he/she cares.",
        "I've been practicing exclusively via telemedicine for the last four years.  I agree with most of the sentiment here, except I find more patients are not fully focused on their appointment (Sorry, but patients under 30 have no social skills or manners, always calling me by my first name and checking social media if there is even a 10 second delay while I check something or click 25 times to update their allergy list).  Driving, taking other phone calls, and shopping are super common during scheduled appointments.  Also, since telemedicine is less intimate and it's more difficult to gain trust, patients are more likely to display rude behavior (especially when it comes to weight loss medications and antibiotics), since they can always hang up and make a new appointment with someone else.  \n\nTelemedicine is a very useful tool for certain issues, but patients are far and away more rude than they were a few years ago, and tend to use it as \"meds on demand\" rather than a medical evaluation with limitations.",
        "As an ER Psychiatrist, I couldn't agree more.",
        "My two  tele-visit experiences:\nThe first was two years ago. It was a second opinion consult with a neurologist at hospital facility several hours away from home with a highly regarded Neurology Department. My medical records and radiology reports were sent to them beforehand. Even though I would be able to be home I still was hesitant it would be a tele-visit. My fears were alleviated when the visit took place. The neurologist reviewed my records with me, even showing the MRI on screen. She patiently listened to my concerns about a possible diagnosis. She scheduled a second appointment at the hospital for a more detailed radiology procedure to be followed up later in the day visit with her once the results were known. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience.\n\nMy second televisit was with my local GP two months ago for a different medical issue. When my GP called me, I assumed it was to go over was the results of tests taken the week before. He matter of factly told me I had cancer and he was putting a rush referral to an oncologist. I was shocked and barely able to speak. The five minute or so conversation was a total blur. I sat in the dining room, and cried and then I got angry. \n\nTwo tele-visits handled in completely different manners. Welcome to new world of a doctor- patient relationship.",
        "Telemedicine is an extension of what I call iPad medicine which is when the doctor spends 95% of the time tapping away on their iPad. At my previous 'wellness' visit the doctor did not even touch me once to check my heartbeat (I am 62) or my skin for skin cancer or check strength and balance. I was so furious as the wellness check is part of my healthplan and I did not feel that I got any benefit from it. I (should) rely on doctors to tell me what to expect from my body as I age (prostate enlargement, etc) but nog, it's get in get out and come back when something actually serious happens (like a heart attack) that they can seriously bill you for. Telemedicine  is the next tool in depersonalizing medicine and this op-ed was probably sponsored by an health insurance company.",
        "I\u2019m glad that video visits forced Dr Ouyang to pay attention to the \u201c person\u201dpart of a visit. The person has been lost during \u201cin person\u201d visits too in favor of servicing corporate technology demands. Clinicians can claw back some of our own by asking \u201cWhat do you want to happen at this visit?\u201dAnd then listening!!!",
        "Hm. Maybe I should schedule a telehealth appointment with my PCP. She's sure not listening when I see her in person. Or in messages in \"MyChart.\" Things can only improve.",
        "A F22 and F35 pilot cannot fly such a complex piece of machinery without computer assistance to survive the split second demands at supersonic speeds.  Are ER surgeons so different?",
        "One troublesome thing with this article is that an ED   doctor should not be doing video visits. This is a prime example of the destruction of primary care. An ED doc should be doing in person emergent care. They need to refer patients back to primary care for follow up. This is classic - take our patients and our billing and  productivity .  Patients want to see their doctor and their medical home. By creating an arm in the ED for video visits that should be in primary care you are not helping the problem- you are exacerbating it.",
        "We need to remember how challenging, and even impossible, telehealth technology can be for older patients. Retirement doesn\u2019t come with an IT department. Many folks who kept house, or worked in blue collar or service jobs, had scant familiarity with the internet even when they were working. Now near-universal snark is the response to an older person asking for tech help.\n\nMy observation is that my over-70 peers and I often just give up in the face of technological obstacles. We use familiar methods and technologies for everyday tasks. But they didn\u2019t always work.  I labored for many hours to get Covid vaccination appointments for older neighbors during the pandemic; it could only be done online. Every entity had a glossy website, but no one answered the phones.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be unable to navigate Amazon\u2019s gift return process.  It\u2019s quite another to be unable to pay your taxes, do your banking, or see a doctor (and don\u2019t forget the barriers of insurance and provider portals). As technology becomes the default (i.e. more profitable) way to access medical care, old people are shut out. I think the healthcare venture capitalists are fine with that.",
        "Interesting article by the Emergency Room physician. \" Sick patients \" who cannot  leave the house  because they are too ill should never be interviewed via Telemedicine. An ER physician may have the skills to communicate , and feel better that she/he may have understood the patient's problem\n,\" without being interrupted\", and then go home satisfied after 12 hour shift, and then never sees or talk to the patient again , but unfortunately will miss the opportunity to speak to the patient,  perform a detailed clinical examination ,  discuss with colleagues and make a reasonable diagnosis and initiate proper treatment.\nIt's too bad that the future generation of young physicians will be be taught to become  good \"TeleDoctors \"  and miss the joy of being a good clinician.\n\nGod help medical care of the future \ud83d\ude4f",
        "It's called progress, not a solution, but progress. \n\nIt's good to read a column written by a Doctor with an open mind who recognizes it as such.\n\nWe Americans are far more used to reading about something like this, where the economic aspect of it is the primary focus and gist of the article.\n\nHow refreshing!",
        "Teletherapy -- the psycho kind -- is less likely to be deeply effective. My office is the Room of Truth (light humor, if you'd like), while clients in teletherapy are sitting at their kitchen table, sitting up in bed, sitting in their car (it's a Freudmobile if they put the seat back), or in some cases, incidentally giving me a tour of their house as they saunter about with smartphone in hand, looking for a relatively quiet place. Clinicians who most value the televised client are not trying to do emotionally expulsive work but the more superficial \"cognitive\" stuff.",
        "The advent of telehealth seems in part to address lack of healthcare in rural communities. We should be asking: why are hospitals closing in rural areas? \n\nI've looked into this and read hospital corporation prospectuses that reveal that CEOs are closing rural hospitals because they bring down their overall profit metrics. City hospitals make more money.\n\nWe need to recognize that healthcare is more like a basic utility than a profit-centric industry, and it's not \"radical\" to say so.\n\nWe don't need telehealth as much as we need to stem the hemorrhaging of rural healthcare.",
        "Telehealth needs to be available to everyone, it should be like a 911 call.  Many patients end up in the ER thinking they have an emergency.  Talking through video with a healthcare provider will help them make a decision if they do need to go to the ER.  911 telehealth will help ease the congestion in the ER.",
        "It almost seems like the media is trying hard to reassure patients that telemedicine is now the standard of care.",
        "Virtual visits are based on sitting in front of a screen and talking to a doctor or NP. What\u2019s missing is a link to diagnostic technology. What required is the use of a home device that can transmit vitals like blood pressure. Even transmitting data from an Apple Watch would be useful.\n\nAs someone living in a rural area with limited access to specialists I\u2019d like to see Telemedicine work. It can be a four hour round trip or longer to see a cardiologist. Combining an office visit with an NP and a telemedicine visit with the specialist would be an excellent way to serve patients.",
        "Many of the comments are binary. Remote care/telehealth is not binary, does not aim to replace in person examinations, when needed but has the potential of helping immensely with access to triage, and follow up care. Thank you for this thoughtful and reflective article.",
        "Interesting reflection of what tele-medicine has to offer. As a retired physician (graduated as a General Surgeon in 1974), I've never had a chance to exam a patient via video, nowadays a must when the patient is unable to leave home or, especially, when a viral epidemia is in full force. Still, I remain convinced that a personal interview, and examination, cannot be replaced fully with a video, no matter how inventive and attentive. Bedside manners are vital so the physician-patient interaction is truly humane. Having said that, today's practice, even when personal, leaves a lot to be desired, as healthcare providers have become employees of the corporate world...whose aim seems more towards profits than patient's wellbeing (of which I can, as a patient now, attest), given the exceedingly short time allowed to meet each other and solve the issue at hand. And we haven't even mentioned what the current private healthcare system lacks, affordability. The recent tragic assassination of a CEO in charge of a Healthcare Corporation seems an urgent reminder of what needs to  change, a universal system where quality preventive care is available to any and all, no questions asked, so the need for treating an established disease (cardiopulmonary, diabetes, malignancy, arthritis, you name it) is at least delayed. As you may agree, life without good health is an awful experience to behold.",
        "It sounds like old-fashioned home doctor visits. What is most revealing to me is the lack of connection the author describes in a chaotic ER. There is still the opportunity for deep face to face connection, but our modern medical system somehow precludes this from naturally occurring. A doctor listening to what a patient needs, rather than just diagnosing - imagine that! I hope we don\u2019t rely on technology for this but can figure out a way to apply it to all aspects of medical care in all encounters.",
        "Absolutely! I had my appendix removed on a Zoom call, and other than that brief interruption when my dog grabbed a roll of gauze and ran all over the house, it was SUPERB. I am not yet that good with sutures, but with any luck I will need further surgeries in the near future ... probably owing to a systemic infection from this first one. So I am in COMPLETE agreement that doctors should NEVER be in the same zip code as their patients, PARTICULARLY ER doctors. If someone gets run over, why aren't we just shoving a camera in his or her face and commencing a chat?",
        "As was the case with many physicians, I was forced to incorporate telehealth into my practice as a result of the pandemic. I found that the televisit was rather reminiscent of house calls that I'd done when I first began Primary Care practice 40 years ago. There was a certain intimacy to both which was absent in the exam room.\nI found the key to a televisit was knowing its limitations. When physical examination was crucial to determine not only what was causing the patient's problem but more importantly the need for urgent testing or intervention, the patient either needed to come into the office or be sent to the ED.",
        "Telehealth is the only reason I have any health care at all. It is a critical option for the millions of us who are too ill or disabled to leave home to attend in person appointments. It's nice to hear a medical professional acknowledging some of the advantages.\n\nTelehealth has not in any way compromised my care. It is my window to having care. It has allowed me more energy to stay focused on the discussion with my doctors, and have much more successful appointments than I had in an office when I could go. With a home pulse ox monitor, BP cuff and 6 lead EKG device, I can share my vitals when needed.  \n\nThe short-term extension of expanded telehealth for Medicare is only getting folks like me through our March appointments. Congress must make this expansion permanent, or many lives will be lost.",
        "I love my tele-heath visits with my doctor. The tests are emailed to him so he can see what ever he needs to read.  And unless it is a situation where a touch and or close up view of something is necessary. It is the same conversation and results as  when I commute to Manhattan from Brooklyn sit in a office and then see my doctor. \nI have a scale and BP cuff at home, so I can tell him my weight and blood pressure if he needs it.  If that is the only reason a physician wants an in person visit, it can easily be remedied.",
        "As a patient I think the televisits are terrific for a follow up or a check in conversation about a health situation, a first pass question, to plan what to do, etc. \n\nI'd much rather spend twenty minutes at home or even sitting in my car, as opposed to\n\nLeave at 1 to park at 1:30 to check in at 1:45 for an appointment at 2 that may actually start at 2:30 then sit waiting for printed paperwork then drive home at 3 to get home at 3:30.  \n\nAnd even better for an older teen who can have parental permission to do so without having to miss school or practice. (It's 16 plus at ours)\n\nAnything you don't absolutely need to bodily be there, it's great.\n\nAlso, with all the weight debate--not that weight never matters, but lack of a weigh in just because, keeps weight from becoming the focus in a situation where it is not immediately relevant.",
        "Doctors, generally, spend no more than five minutes with patients. There is no real two way communication, just doctor talking. Telehealth provides better interaction, if they are longer. With everything stored in cloud the physician can easily look at the blood report, x-ray, EKG, etc. on another window or screen. Because telehealth appointments are immediate the patients do not wonder and wait for days and weeks while waiting to see doctors. Also, transportation problems are solved. Telehealth is a win-win.",
        "I believe under debate is whether a number of telehealth benefits under Medicare put in place during  Covid will continue. Specifically, those mentioned here: \n\n<a href=\"https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/telehealth-policy/policy-changes-after-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency\" target=\"_blank\">https://telehealth.hhs.gov/providers/telehealth-policy/policy-changes-after-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency</a>\n\nThis article implicitly makes the case for their continuance. Telehealth obviously has significant limits- and there can issues such as fraud- that permeates all US medical care. It obviously is beneficial in certain use cases, particularly if used in conjunction with physical visits.",
        "No. It\u2019s more trouble for everyone to meet in person but there is no substitute for actually seeing, feeling, hearing and smelling a real person instead of watching a miniature image made of pixels on a screen. Covid made everyone lazier and now everyone wants to work from home. As a result all service has degraded. Stop justifying it.",
        "An interesting concern. As I psychologist I have had in person visits and online visits. Both have value. \n\nWith online visits I have been able to see the surroundings of the home  which helped me understand  the conditions  in their home and family. \n\nPoor families and homeless people were able to communicate by iPhones  which everyone seemed to have or borrow. Transportation was often limited but they could  usually find a place to speak.  Seeing people living in a garage definitely helped me understand their concerns. \n\nIn person office visits provided other information  on a more personal basis. \n\nCY",
        "My brother in Denver made an in-person appointment for routine preventative dental care. After the hygienist was finished cleaning he was connected to a dentist (supposed) on a screen who started telling him of work he needed to. He asked and learned the dentist was viewing his image from India. He walked out never to return. \n\nStop this nonsense now. This doesn\u2019t improve patient care. Stop selling us lies.",
        "I am glad you think so. In fact you are participating in the increasing distance between doctors and patients and the continuing deterioration of hands-on diagnostic skill of doctors.",
        "I understand why this obviously compassionate doctor finds a positive side to telehealth visits, but nothing  will ever replace two human beings, in the same room, talking to each other face to face.",
        "Excellent piece, Dr. Ouyang!  And many thoughtful comments from health care professionals and patients.  \n\nHave been a telehealth advocate for over 40 years, but until the Covid pandemic, many in the medical community fought its adoption, including the American Medical Association and their lobbyists before state legislators.  Fortunately, times are changing.\n\nState medical licensure and reimbursements still remain as impediments...imagine if the pilots on your cross-country flights had to be independently licensed for overflight by each state boundary crossed...that's medicine today.  The Veterans Administration has found ways through healthcare policy for their physicians to provide exceptional and appropriate care for our Nation's heroes across state borders.  Teladoc has also made significant inroads for employers to provide a fantastic perk, particularly for working parents.\n\nYounger physicians are seeing the benefits of current telehealth technology as well as embracing artificial intelligence in their practices.  Seems like an exciting time to see significant advances in 21st Century healthcare.",
        "My husband began his veterinary practice by going on house calls. Even when we built a state of the art veterinary hospital and kennel, he continued to make house calls one day a week. He learned so much about his patients and their owners from this practice. Seeing how the animals lived helped him with diagnoses and treatment. In some ways, the virtual human medicine visit is a modern house call.",
        "If telemedicine works for you, then great. But it\u2019s just another bandaid for the gaping wound that is American healthcare.",
        "I'm feeling like my \"medical care\" these days is all about tests. If a Telehealth visit got a doctor to listen to me instead of ordering yet another kind of scan, I'm for it.",
        "Is Helen an AI? That\u2019s the important question here. All human doctors will soon be replaced by AI, even the ones rendering hands on services. Can she pass the Turing Test? I would encourage all of Helen\u2019s patients to ask the appropriate questions now, and draw their own conclusions. You\u2019ll be so much happier if she doesn\u2019t pass.",
        "Good doctors care about their patients. It is as simple as that. The US system is so monetized that it breeds indifference. I do not think there is any conspiracy afoot, it is just how it is organized. The knocks on the Canadian system, at least in the context of the US one, are pure baloney. I get sick, I go to a hospital and I don't pay a dime, except for parking. Been there had that. And the sicker you are the faster they get on it. Vote for that.",
        "As a patient with a chronic illness, I have no interest in the soul of medicine, nor do I want a deeper connection with a doctor.  \n    Doctors should not serve as armchair psychologists either.  \n     Like you said, focus on my diagnosis, my safety, and then recommend a treatment strategy.  I would also appreciate it if you would tell me the side effects of a drug that you are prescribing.  If we do it by phone, that\u2019s fine. But we can\u2019t do a physical exam and you know that.",
        "While a video (like Zoom) is preferable to a telephone interview it does not really take the place of a face to face contact where the doctor can observe the patient in all dimensions- subtle facial expressions, body language, postures, etc.  That I what I insisted on for my most recent neurological exam and my doctor agreed.",
        "My one telehealth visit caused me to drop my primary care doc. She was abrupt and seemed rushed. I had no particular concerns and she made me feel as if this annual check was wasting her time. I found a family practice that schedules in-person visits easily and also responds promptly to emails. No need for telehealth at all.",
        "I am reminded of what I've read about health-care in Cuba, where each neighborhood has a nurse, and that nurse knows the people in the neighborhood -- all her patients -- and has a much more intimate view of their health and home lives than a doctor or nurse practitioner will ever get from visiting someone in a medial facility.\n\nHealth care in Cuba is universal, affordable, and focuses on prevention. It has become a model for the rest of the world. Maybe better and more frequent Telehealth visits are a tiny step toward replicating that in the US.",
        "This is called testing validation.\n\nSometimes people just need to be heard by the doctor. Then the doctor could put together a differential diagnosis for the patient, explaining what some of the suspected conditions might be to explain the symptoms. Then, the physician should try to put these potential considerations into perspective, (i.e., commonplace, uncommon, routine, non-urgent, urgent, emergent, etc.)\n\nThen as a patient I can help decide how I wish to proceed (observationally, observationally with caution, limited testing, screening testing, emergent testing, etc.)\n\nThat's the perspective the patient may wish, personal validation.  But this takes time.\n\nBecause of rush and haste we resort to \"testing validation\", let's order CT and MRI of everything even if it is overkill. Let's just keep things moving. The patient then knows \"something\" is being done to address their concerns.\n\nI see it as a radiologist. I love looking at the minute details on those images. A lot of it seems overkill in the clinical context.\n\nWe need to slow down, listen to the patients and put their ailments in perspective rather than rushing to test.",
        "Congress just stripped a provision from the spending bill that would expand Telehealth for Rural Health Clinics and Community Health Centers.  Right now, these providers cannot get paid \u201cnormally\u201d tor Telehealth encounters if the patient is in their home. Politicians talk about supporting \u201crural\u201d but they do not follow through.",
        "Telehealth may work well for some areas of medicine, but for others (orthopedics, neurology) where a detailed physical examination is essential, it falls short.  Sadly, in these cases it is only exacerbating the already fading art of the physical examination and increasing reliance on expensive testing (MRIs, etc) and specialty referrals which in turn drive medical expenses ever upward.",
        "One of the best and most efficient interactions with a health care provider I experienced was via telephone during the Covid pandemic. On day 4 of symptoms and unable to keep water down, I contacted urgent care, and was told I may meet criteria for Paxlovid and a physician would call back for a telephone assessment. Within the hour, the MD called, and after an assessment was told a prescription would be available for paxlovid along with ondansetron to quell the vomiting. In addition, he provided counseling on taking Paxlovid and what to expect, with sufficient clarity and detail to make this retired pharmacist's heart sing (docs know a lot, but that knowledge doesn't always encompass medication counseling). Within the hour, my husband returned from the pharmacy with the meds and by evening I was keeping down clear liquids thanks to the ondansetron. This interaction took less than two and a half hours. Telehealth has its place in the care of patients, applied to the proper situation and with the applicable skill set of the practitioner.",
        "So then I hired a consierge doctor so might get all my age related health issues dealt with.  I paid a monthly fee to see him, but found he was on vacation 65% of the time and when I saw him he talked \u201cat me\u201d and did not listen.  He looked at his laptop the entire visit.   He had a nurse practitioner do most of his work.   So paying extra does not ensure quality medical care.  I simply think doctors do not care about anything other than money.",
        "My primary car doctor and I get together in her office about half the time and via video the other half.  It's great for both of us.  When we meet online, she has all my charts, test results etc. at her fingertips.  This is convenient and thorough and smart.",
        "Kaiser has included phone call visits  in primary care. We are elderly and need to discuss many different kinds of things happening to our bodies often. We have gotten to know our care giver very well ,and have a close relationship with her. She knows well our heart, lung, skin, bone, you name it, and the fact that they are on going problems. Telehealth and simple phone calls save office visits and provide immediate care. Plus she can see many more patients by phone than through her office.",
        "I love telehealth appointments!! And they have been a godsend for my husband.\n\nIn July of 2023 he had his in person physical and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. He was SO ANGRY at himself. He came home, immediately started a low carb diet, and lost 35 lbs.\n\nHis A1C levels are normal without any added meds, and he was able to halve his BP meds.\n\nI mention this all because with the exception of his in person physical, he was able to meet with our trusted doctor of 25 years via Zoom during this health crisis. \n\nShe was able to track his progress with him. He took his BP and blood sugar readings daily and sent them to her. They discussed them each appointment, and she was so proud of him. This kept him on track, ensured he was following medical advice, and he didn't have to take a ton of time off work to attend appointments.\n\nI can assure you this would not have occured if he had been obligated to attend an in-person appointment each month. \n\nTelehealth has a place in medicine.",
        "I find telehealth appointments suitable and satisfactory for most things, however I recently learned, quite by accident, that i have a leaky heart valve that was easily heard through a stethoscope. Not having seen a Dr. in person for a checkup for years makes me reevaluate the wisdom of this practice.",
        "This is a false dichotomy. Since the invention of the telephone patients have spoken with their doctors remotely. \n\nTo make this something new is an attempt to suggest that \u201ctele-treatment\u201d is in any way a replacement for personal visits. They are not. Hedge fund managers and investment bankers think is progress. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s only a way for them to make more money, more quickly, and will further undermine the quality of American healthcare.",
        "I'm disabled and try to do televisits whenever possible. Why must we bother schlepping into the doctors office when most of your time together he/she spends inputting info into the computer with their back to you while I talk and maybe if I'm lucky, they'll feel around a little for a minute or two afterwards?",
        "I too was a skeptic, even as a psychiatric provider because I thought using my five senses was irreplaceable. I was wrong. The accessibility to my services for underserved patients without transportation or sometimes the will to get out of bed has more than made up for the small non-visual cues I miss in getting the whole picture during assessment. Telepsych has improved getting help out to people in the community who really need it.",
        "As with most things in life, it is not \"either-or,\" but \"both-and.\"  There are many situations in which it is critically important to see a practitioner in person.  In other situations, telehealth can be extremely useful, particularly in rural areas where provider networks are thin, or if the patient has transportation problems.  The appropriate intervention is the one that best meets the needs of the specific patient within his or her current circumstances.",

        "While I agree with you to a degree, I find that some people call while they are driving or eating or grocery shopping!  I am very disheartened to see that the reimbursement for telemedicine is returning to a minuscule amount after Jan 1. I personally prefer in patient visits for my specialty dermatology as it often requires touch feel and a dermatoscope. However, if what is being discussed is drug management of chronic disease or as you said a patient struggling to understand their own disease and symptoms (I have been there as a patient as well) it makes a great deal of sense. I don\u2019t understand the priorities of the federal government to continue to cut Medicare services whilst spending so much on other things that don\u2019t produce as much human value. But there is nothing more gratifying than a patient\u2019s gratitude. And as you said, sometimes us doctors forget that understanding and empathy are healing as well as a diagnosis and treatment plan. When they are served together that is great medicine!",

That includes occasions when I was able to avert a disaster.\n\nThere is a correct way to conduct an in-person visit.  I could describe it, but even an outline would be too long for this response.  However, in reply to some of today\u2019s critiques, please note that the in-person visit should be exclusively focused on the patient and should not permit interruptions except for emergencies.  One cannot argue for telemedicine by comparing it with substandard in-person visits.",
        "I really dislike video appointments. It does not feel like a human connection or caring \u2014 just a cold image on a computer screen. Might as well be a computer generated image. Please do not try to tell me that these feel like intimate conversations. Without measuring the temperature, pulse, and blood pressure or being able to run tests, it doesn\u2019t feel reliable.\n\nAlbert Mehrabian, a researcher of body language, who studied the components of a face-to-face conversation, found that communication is 55% nonverbal, 38% vocal, and 7% words only. Video is not the same even if it saves money for insurance companies.\n\nOur health care provider uses advice hotlines that can help us decide whether we need care, arrange for tests, and set appointments at urgent care or with our regular physician. Sometimes a generalist will use electronics to quickly get advice from a specialist who analyzes the test results without seeing the patient separately. All of this is helpful, but I want to sit in a room my personal physician and trust what she says. Please do not tell me how convenient it is for me to use remote video appointments that help providers save money. It\u2019s not my goal to help insurance companies save money in a manner that significantly lowers the quality medical care.",
        "I've only used telehealth a couple of times, but it worked then.  I knew I had UTIs both time, the nurse practitioner who was on the other side agreed with my assessment of my symptoms and put in orders for me to go get tested in a nearby lab and followed up with appropriate antibiotics.  She also put in a referral to a specialist after it became apparent my UTIs were recurrent.  I feel like it can be part of an overall strategy but probably works better for some things than for others.",

        "Using the anecdotal is problematic in that it sees a picture distorted by the single instance.\n\nAn ER physician from a prestigious Ivy League Medical School is not to be lightly attacked, but nor is it good to accept some of the judgments made without some further consideration.\n\nFrom my Primary Care experience, most any patient profits from being heard out!   This should not be seen as a revelation, but it is hardly enough!\n\nPatients often know that their diagnosis may be difficult after many rounds with many other providers and they are grateful for being heard and that can be done in any setting.\n\nI worry that Telehealth lacks not only the testing, but the hands on effect. Touch, so long as appropriate, is beneficial and the near lost art of physical exam is also to be noted.\n\nOne can inspect for certain and can see requested movement in neurological and skeletal exams, but auscultation and percussion are totally impeded and they have and will perhaps continue to be valued by at least some in my past field of pursuit.\n\nAn ER physician may not have the time to do extended physical exams.  Bedside exams as I have noted no longer hold for the most part.  Most patients, such as myself are examined through our clothes now!\n\nWe see cases such as that of Amazon's 'One Medical' now as a 45-year old who needlessly died and the resulting law suit declared from its occurrence.\n\nWe need to balance the case made here with the full realization that telehealth too often is not enough.",

With the increased use of wearable devices, including at-home blood pressure mechanisms, we can get a much better read than we could arriving at a clinic with our racing heart beats, and the first thing they do is record your heart rate (not an accurate method). At one point we'll be able to save time by first consulting our own AI before wasting time with a clinician. Once a suitable blood sampling method is available to the many, we'll send off our own blood to a lab, and have AI check it for signs. The future of humanity looks great!",

Most of that time was spent in a crowded waiting area with a TV blaring, extremely uncomfortable chairs (my wife had a back ache for days after) and close proximity to people with who knows what infections and no masks.

Some of the metrics doctors commonly rely on in an in-person setting, like a person's weight, tend to get in the way of quality health care.

And if you need labs or blood pressure, they simply put in an order and you pop over to LabCorp (or whatever you have in your community) and get it done.\n\nIn short, where in-person medicine allows doctors to just order tests and make the call based on those results (which can be \"everything is in normal range\" (and if you're a woman, \"lose weight and here's a psych referral\"), telehealth makes them have to listen.",

It would be great if there were more home assessment devices that we could own or 'borrow' locally (e.g. stethoscope).

        "This was a great thing to write a piece about. I have a chronic neck and shoulder spasm, the only successful treatment for which that I've found is routinely receiving targeted medical massage. This is very expensive. I had heard that a Letter of Medical Necessity from a provider could make these visits eligible for FSA reimbursement, but without knowing the likelihood that a provider would be willing to write such a letter, I could just never find a time where it felt worth giving up potentially several hours of a work day to go try to get one. Not to mention that if there were paperwork issues or my FSA administrator required a follow-up, that would have required potentially an additional visit and several more hours. Once I got used to telehealth, I realized I could make as many appointments as I wanted and they would only take 15 minutes a piece from the comfort of my home or office. I visited a few times with the same provider, and all we needed was to have a couple of conversations. The provider even waited on the line with me while I figured out with the FSA administrator what paperwork was needed. Now, after many years, I can save a LOT on my treatment because I finally have a letter. For minor issues like this, telehealth has been game changing for me. I no longer avoid going to the doctor due to time issues or being unsure if it will be \"worth it.\"",

No one wants me to go to the office for that!\n\nFrom my point of view as a patient, the up side is not that my MD can see me in my home environment, which is unremarkable, but that her ability to truly listen to me is enhanced. Unable to touch me, she asks deeper questions and really listens to the answers. The seemingly outlier symptoms that might be dismissed in the busy office now enhance the correct diagnosis.  Instead of jumping to the most common idea, we get to the real thing.\n\nSo while virtual visits cannot really replace in-person examination, we can take some things about it that work and apply them to the office or urgent care setting.",

Over 2 weeks after initial symptoms after 2 virtual check ups I saw a doctor. She Immediately sent me to ER with a note asking for urgent attention.

        "I am a psychiatrist, now beginning my 51st year in practice.  When COVID started, I began using ZOOM.  Initially, it was exhausting. It turned out I felt obliged to be making 'direct eye contact' all the time. This meant staring at the green dot that was the camera.  After about 3 months - I realized that in my office, while eye contact was crucial, it was not continuous.  It was then that I felt more natural with the format.  I began to ask my patients how they found this new medium.  Almost all said they preferred it.  They did not have to drive to my office, look for parking and then drive home, taking usually 3 hours out of their day.  They also like the familiarity of being in the own home, or at times in their cars or even in the bathroom when a partner was in the apartment and they wanted privacy. It was much easier to reschedule appointments because one only needed an hour and not 3. I now feel that the two are different, one not being better than the other.  There is an intensity in the 'cyber-proximity' of our faces.  It is revealing to see something about where the person lives and to learn something more about their environments.  The teens and college kids I see are more comfortable lying on their beds, lounging in a comfortable chair and are less likely to miss appointments. And I realized that it had taken nearly 8 hours a week of driving to get to my office.  For me, I could have a leisurely breakfast with my family and sleep another hour.",

        "As a therapist who moved my practice virtually during the pandemic and stayed there, I have found both benefits & losses.  I learned to rely on my words more because I couldn't lean over and hand a  tearful, suffering patient a tissue.  On the other hand,  not only have I had a window into people's homes, workplaces, & yes cars, pets & children but  the convenience rules out missed sessions due to inclement weather or physical impairments (particularly with the elderly) with broken legs, orthopedic surgeries etc. I was particularly able to continue with a dying young woman from her bed and throughout all her chemo treatments. \nFrom an economic level, telemental health has enabled more therapists to accept insurance without the overhead burden of paying rent for an office.",
        "I don\u2019t think anyone especially docs should generalize. I see patients for insurance. Telehealth has challenges just like in-person medicine has challenges. Not every patient is coming with a mystery diagnosis that needs a physical exam. Many just need their meds re-filled. I do psychiatry and sleep medicine by telehealth and it works extremely well. By \u201cextremely well\u201d I mean, when everything works and patients do their job. I don\u2019t change my standards for telehealth, a bad connection is a bad connection we get less done and I don\u2019t \u201ccompromise\u201d. You have to accept that things don\u2019t always go well, and so does the patient. But by and large they do, and there is a learning curve for both the patient and me to learn the technology. Do I get as much done with a fragmented connection and an uncooperative patient as I would in person? Of course not. But I get uncooperative patients in person too. When I have inferred bad telehealth care, the clinicians appeared to use a different standard for telehealth encounters than they did for in person encounters, documenting physical exams they couldn\u2019t have done for example or templating questions they couldn\u2019t have asked or education they couldn\u2019t have provided. If one adheres to the same standards as usual, telehealth isn\u2019t a substitute, but a valuable augmentation of medical practice.",

Medicare has covered telehealth visits since the COVID pandemic, but will no longer do so as of January 1, so I will need either to make the round trip to his office or pay 100% out of pocket.

Then, as an actual patient, I've seen the docs in the exam room being fractal jerks in front of students who were shadowing them in a way that completely undid the examples that I know the student had in school.   The students are taught these skills, then when they are out and seeing patients, are told by practitioners that \"there's no time for that school stuff, here's how we've always done it\".

Fortuitously she actually had one of the seizures during the video appointment, and the specialist was able to see the problem as it happened.  And talk to her about the experience as it was happening.\n\nIt could have happened in an office visit, but she would never have traveled cross-country to see this specialist.  It was a lucky coincidence, but her regular doctors were grateful for the information it provided them.  I can see where virtual visits could help with some problems.",

        "I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands in the 60s and 70s. Whenever someone in the household was sick, our family doctor would come around for a home visit. The same was true in Brussels, Belgium, where I lived for most of my adult life. \nDuring the many decades I lived in various countries in Europe, I never once had to fill in paperwork about the state of my hearing, the frequency of any headaches or the regularity of my bowel movements, nor did I ever see an assistant to take my vitals before sitting down face to face with my \"provider\". Instead, any visit to my cardiologist in Vienna, Austria, would start with a conversation about my general well-being, her asking relevant questions about my health (not about my hearing), and her taking my blood pressure. No assistant in sight. \nI am not a physician, but I suspect these doctors were more in touch with their patients and were no less effective than their counterparts in the US. Moreover, all of the above happened for a fraction of the amounts I've grown accustomed to seeing on the \"explanations of benefits\" from my insurance company. Still, I don't believe they were any worse off than the doctors I currently see in New York City. \nIt sounds like telemedicine appointments are exposing American doctors to a somewhat similar experience for the first time. It is a sad reflection on the state of healthcare in the US that this should be such a revelatory experience.",

        "I never had the opportunity to do telehealth visits when I was practicing surgery, but I did a lot of phone calls -- which can function as a telehealth visit.   These were not just a matter of answering a question while on call.  These calls were also used to offload my office hours for certain types of follow-up care.  These worked well, because we all learned in med school that 80 to 90 percent of the diagnosis comes from the history.  Therefore, a key component of the call was my silence, time to listen, time to assess the patient's anxiety, if any.  The key was to assess endangerment, something so far awry that in-person assessment was necessary.  The challenge was to ask the right question communicated in a clear, logical manner.",
        "While it's interesting to hear about a positive side of telehealth from a practicing doc, there is another lesson to be drawn from Dr Ouyang's repeated description of the distracting havoc common in an average ER.

There is no way a doctor is going to be able to do a proper History and Physical exam to correctly assess the patient's health.

As much as possible, telemedicine practice should be restricted to cases where actual patient encounters are practically difficult .",

Bought and paid for Congressmen and women will go right along and do what ever the first lobbyist tells him or her, either pro or con.

        "Technology is a tool. Like any tool, it's critical to use the right tool for the task. We don't use a sledge hammer to hang up a picture, and we don't use a nail clipper to cut the lawn.\n\nI think E.R. doctors simply need more uninterrupted time to spend with a patient, to listen them, and observe them. Some of the subtle intangibles seen are helpful in diagnosis.\n\nThere are times when a telephone visit is certainly easier for a patient, such as when visiting the doctor in person would be a strain. Some illnesses are minor and a telephone consult is all that's needed. Telephone consults should be available. But there are other times when a doctor should listen to the heart and breathing, perhaps do bloodwork or other tests. Maybe an x-ray is in order. There are times in a telephone consult when a doctor might recognize the need for a patient to come in.\n\nClosely related to this issue is insurance company supervision and medical malpractice fears. Even 50 years ago insurance companies second guessed diagnoses and procedures.  Doctors looked over their shoulder out of fear of a lawsuit and practiced 'defensive medicine' to cover themselves.\n\n\nAs to technology in record keeping, there's much that can be done now, but the system is fouled up.

        "While I agree that the environment in my outpatient private practice differs from a chaotic emergency room, I too am often interrupted when seeing patients. That is simply the nature of a busy practice. The answer is not to embrace virtual appointments as a substitute for strong medical care. The overwhelming majority of medical practice still requires both a careful history and in person physical examination.
