        "Sex is genetic and so is assigned at conception.  Sex assigned at birth is like saying eye color assigned at birth.  Science matters, they say.",
        "A very long article stating the obvious. Biological sex is a fact, not an opinion.",
        "It is sad to see academics attempting to get sympathy for their 'philosophical' opinions by writing up an opinion essay in a newspaper, instead of authoring a scientific paper and submitting it to a reputable journal (where their peers can judge the truth and veracity of their position/findings). To me, this even borders on pathetic.",
        "Another downside of \"sex assigned at birth\" is that sex was assigned in the womb already, not at birth.  At birth, doctors/nurses just observed the baby's genitals and recorded that on the birth certificate.  Nothing was \"assigned\" at that point, just recorded.",
        "Sex is a constellation of hormonal, gonadal, genital, and genetic characteristics. Sex is typically assigned at birth based on genital appearance. Western medicine makes a point of deciding what constitutes normality for \u201cmale\u201d vs \u201cfemale\u201d genitals based on appearance and functionality (explicitly regarding the ability to have reproductive, heterosexual sex) over the last century. If anyone actually read Foucault or Butler, they\u2019d understand that social constructionism isn\u2019t denying biological reality - like the existence of intersex people. Social constructivism simply gives us a lens to historically situate how people make sense of, and meaning to, bodies in a given time and place. It warns us away from biological essentialism because essentialism seeks to eradicate diversity in the service of hegemony. If human sexual dimorphism was infallible, there would be no need to surgically \u201ccorrect\u201d intersex infants when no medically necessary reason for surgery exists. Trans people wanting healthcare would also not be threatening. A final thought experiment to all readers - have you been karyotyed? If not, how do you know you\u2019re really a man or woman? (If your answer lies with another component of sex assigned at birth, how you feel, or some combination of these things, welcome to the social constructivist club. And don\u2019t forget that the presence of external genitalia doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not intersex! About 1 in 2000 people are and don\u2019t find out until they try to conceive.)",

        "Very simple. First, leave gender out of it. Call it \u201csex observed at birth\u201d. Problem solved.",
        "The good professor should audit a course on  embryology or sexual reproduction and development. Perhaps sex assigned at birth isn't a great term but there is not a binary of sexes. Typically males have an XY chromosomal sex and females have an XX chromosomal sex. However, aneuploidy and other chromosomal aberrations are more typically survivable with the sex chromosomes than the remaining 22 autosomal ones. Is a Turner syndrome female not female because she has only.one X chromosome? How about an XXY male? Or epigenetic cases in which the placental ennvironment leads to ambiguous genitalia?",
        "It strikes me that this whole discussion is yet once again rooted in the realm of organized religious foolishness which is why it can't be understood for what it is - a rare biological anomaly of Mother Nature's made into a culture war by the stupidity factor associated with said religious based bigots who have since time began lived in mortal fear of any form of sexual activity - once the three letters, S-E-X, are in the mix.  It shouldn't have to be explained any further.  Society has made a bit of progress in that there now exist in many public spaces unisex restrooms and college dorms with mixed genders living amongst each other.  There are also humans whose gender assignment which includes both male and female physical and mental leanings might want to identify more with one than the other.  Why should that bother anyone else?  \nIt does seem to bother an excessive number of politicians in certain parts of this country.",
        "This is what happens when people conflate sex with gender.",
        "People used to say the N-word all the time, too, but we stopped treating those who were offended by it like they were subhuman. It didn't make them lesser to use a new term- any term was just about better. Maybe the people who are offended by being called a woman just because they get a period would rather be called a person who menstruates. I am also a person who menstruates and while it's clunky language, it's not offensive to me, does not erase my womanhood, and quite frankly I didn't always menstruate and hope to live long enough to stop eventually. It's not sufficient or necessary to being a woman. Quite frankly, most everyone hates linguistics and semantics which is why this irks and annoys so many people, but most of us also want to be decent human beings and not hurt people who are routinely marginalized and being legislated out of existence. The next accurate term will just be the oppressed and it will apply to all of us if we let this word choice outrage nonsense guide our voting behavior.",
        "DNA is DNA. Regardless of how one feels about one\u2019s sex at birth.",
        "Life is unfair. Nature does not care. Babies and small children develop cancer and the only treatments will permanently alter their development and ability to reproduce. Children are born with incompletely or poorly developed organ systems. None of this is fair but it\u2019s real. People may want life to be without unkindnesses and danger, to save the little children, but the natural forces at work since the Big Bang, do not care. \n\nBut that is just one factor related to this, \u201c safetyism\u201d. Uncertainty. No people can know the future and not knowing cannot anticipate undesirable results, unfair results. Liberty, individual agency, freedom of conscience are all rejections of assertions that humans can make human life perfect if the right beliefs and conduct are assured for the greater good. This movement is a rejection of liberal social philosophy that rejected society having authority to deny individuals any rights not granted by rulers who claimed infallibility due to divine right. It\u2019s going to end the respect for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness because these do not assure safety and comfort. \n\nGender is the result of bisexual reproduction which assures diversity of individuals and greater adaptability for the species. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s choice, it\u2019s how evolution found a solution that promotes the perpetuation of life. It\u2019s no more assigned than having a heart is assigned. The psychology of sex is not a binary proposition, but gender is about reproduction.",

There are so many woke absurdities also here in Canada (biological males in female sports etc.) Voters are also getting tired of our woke-in-chief Justin Trudeau. \nWe are all (except for a very, very few exceptions) born with either XX or XY chromosomes.

Yes biological sex matters, for example if the Cleveland clinic billed Blue Cross for a prostate exam on someone assigned female at birth that would cause a claims denial, but thats a small thing that doesnt affect much.

Which, in all honesty, proves the need to further specify \u201csex assigned at birth\u201d. The authors also fail to acknowledge the handful of factors that go into defining biological sex (hormones, DNA, and genitalia) and thereby ignore the existence of people who are intersex. This article is an irresponsible opinion piece, by authors who claim to be experts, but display knowledge that is about two generations behind.",
        "The existence of intersex people does not invalidate the obvious binary aspect of sex that is present in humans and other animals. Small gametes (sperm) indicate male. Large gametes (eggs) indicate female.\n\nAs a physician I can assure you that we do not talk like this. We use \"43 year old male\" or \"76 year old woman\". This is for obvious reasons. If a 76 year old woman has metastatic cancer on a CT scan, no doctor is wondering whether it came from the prostate.",
        "I have wondered about the potential for confusion in diagnosing heritable conditions, especially those that are passed on specifically by a male or female parent. If the patient identifies family members (especially those not present at the consult) by non-biological gender, could that ever impact the interpretation of symptoms?\n\nStep can be taken to prevent this, I suppose. Yet dissonance will likely persist for a while in an exchange such as:\n\nDOCTOR: Is there a history of ovarian cancer in your family?\n\nPATIENT: Yes, my father.\n\nAnd since some man actually get breast cancer, asking about that  would be even trickier.",

        "This article relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of transgender and transsexual politics and realities. Sex assigned at birth is useful for intersex people who are assigned a binary sex at birth, even though neither their genitalia nor chromosomes match binary sexes. It is also useful for trans people who may alter their biology gender through treatments of various types. This reading of sexes erases intersex people, who make up as much as 1-2% of any given population (animals included!!), continually perpetuating violence of erasure against trans people. It follows this politic that there is no biological justification for trans-ness and that trans people are gender-confused, needing extra coddling from society. This couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nPlease stop pushing harmful messaging that attempts to erase trans people by using the veneer of science and objectivity. The examples from the animal kingdom are cherry-picking at best, and the fact a piece like this was allowed to besmirch the face of this paper should be seen as a red flag to all editors.

These side effects are rooted in biological differences between men and women.\n\nBut male violence (they commit more murders and sexual assaults) have *nothing* to do with male biology and *everything* to do with societal rules/laws about gender -- about what is allowed for men vs women, about what is expected of men vs women.\n\nFor the AUs to present those two disparate statistical \"supports\" for their argument is sloppy at best and grossly deceptive at worst.",

As if those are immutable traits of a biological Male human? It's pretty east to argue that the Cancer risk and maybe even the Covid is related to cultural gender identity (not going the doctor as often, stress, work place exposures, etc...)\n\nThat's all I need to read to see that this person is not basing their arguments on any kind of scientific fact but making arguing to enable hate behind a pretty flimsy veneer of 'indisputable science'.",
        "The real problem is that this has been approached from the complete opposite of logic.  If you examine the issue carefully the ONLY clear cut cases on the gender spectrum are those who consider themselves trans.  They are in the wrong body.  if you were born with a penis you are male and if you were born with a vagina you are female (unless you believe it was a mistake).  What should be explored is the differing levels and degrees a person can be male or female. Standing naked and telling others that what they're seeing isn't real is disingenuous.  Being female or being male can mean many different things once you accept what you were born with and that it does not have to limit you.  Sex assigned at birth is only relevant to a trans person.  All the others who believe male or female are dirty words should rethink this issue.  A man who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger and only sleeps with women who then insists he is not male is not doing a service to anybody who wants to expand on sex and gender classifications.  If recognition and acceptance is the goal, this is not the way to go about it.",

Most will comfortably identify as such; some (those who are trans or gender-nonconforming) may have a sense of self out of sync with that biology.  \n\nIn the case of trans folks, it is cruel to insist that they live into the biological sex ('assigned at birth') which does not fit who they experience themselves to be.",

        "A person's sex isn't miraculously defined at birth, nor is it assigned, which might give the impression that the medical profession or parents have some choice in the matter.\nSex is something that develops well before birth early during gestation, it may even be at conception.\nA name is assigned and can be changed later in life, but sex isn't and can't. \nA healthy person without a genetic or physical abnormality is either born male or female, their sex is obvious at birth even to the untrained eye.\nAdditionally, sex and gender are one and the same thing. Attempts to distinguish between sex and gender are simply a linguistic device used to unnecessarily complicate what is a very simple situation by those that want to pretend that sex can be changed.\nA person may grow up and be unhappy with their sex, and take steps to present and live as a member of the opposite sex, but nothing they can do can alter their fundamental underlying genetic characteristics which developed in their mother's womb.",
        "Biologically, sex is a) not as binary as people would like to assume (see intersex) and b) often not relevant. Not just for humans, but for all animals that have sexual dimorphism (and there are those that don't). Saying \"women are nearly twice as likely as men to experience harmful side effects from drugs\" collapses the experiences of all women into one group, rather than looking for actual differences that might predict specific side effects for a given individual. It's an emphasis on the average with no acknowledgement of variance, on a distribution that will usually be at least bimodal, if not multimodal. More to the point, emphasizing a strong binary difference makes it easy for some to make assumptions about individuals just because of their chromosomes, completely ignoring the development that happens after birth, whether psychological or physical or both. We can be smarter and more nuanced than that. Words can be familiar to everyone in a society without being sufficient or appropriate.",

It also doesn\u2019t fit to call them male because they will have different medical needs than a cisgender guy. Birth sex, history of gender affirming medical care, gender socialization, gender presentation, and gender identity are all different things, and I think people like these authors get obviously confused when trying to conflate them into a couple terms like sex and gender.

        "The author is a philosopher and their lack of attention to the details of science is prominent. For more than 20 years biologists have been taught that sex is a phenotype - a characteristic that is expressed, and therefore must be observed. Phenotypes are not confirmation of the actual genotype - in this case the combination of X and Y chromosomes, which can only be known with genetic sequencing. The author confuses these two separate classifications. Why is this important? Many people in the public believe sex is about what genitalia you have (the phenotype) while scientists sometimes make distinctions between the genitalia and chromosomes (genotype). Hence, the phrase \u201csex change\u201d. \u201cSex assigned at birth\u201d makes it clear that the form (or medical journal article) is interested in the best approximation of the genotype that is available (since we do not sequence most individuals genomes) - not the phenotype which can be altered by a \u201csex change\u201d procedure or treatment. It is the genotype that is most relevant in all of the example the author provides of why sex is important.

I have seen the hypothesis  that the brain processes underlying sexual preference are not always in synch with those underlying the overt biological sexual characteristics . When some gay persons I have heard  say that they knew they were attracted to the same sex very early in life, this suggests  that the brain processes underlying sexual preferences may go in a different direction than the overt biology.\n\nSome conservatives claim that homosexuality is the result of social pressures, hence the 'Don't Say Gay' movements in some states. There's probably at least some truth in this.  \n\nThen there is  sexual dysphoria, where you wish you were the other than . People have adopted the look and dress of the opposite sex forever.

Your gender can align with your sex. Gender roles are constructs, and one should be able to embrace their preferred construct, their perceived reality, but the sex you were born into is your sex, unless you proceed with physical biological interventions, but do those completely shift your biological arrow?",

My hunch is that overall this top-down dictating of language regarding the sexes is stirring far more resentment than tolerance toward trans people/\n\nMoreover, using the words \"pregnant \"people\" to make trans people feel better comes at the price of making women feel worse.

        "This philosopher and biologist have clearly not bothered to read the history of the science of sex and gender. Nelly Oudshoorn, Anne Fausto-Sterling, and Cordelia Fine have shown that \"sex\" is a social classification system that humans - scientists, physicians, state actors, and regular people, among others - have created and tweaked over time. It's a decision flowchart - nothing more. What the authors describe as \"fact\" has actually morphed over history: for example, scientists and medical professionals in, say, 18th century Europe defined maleness and femaleness very differently than how the same professionals do now (in Europe and elsewhere). No one is arguing that body parts, organs, and hormones aren't real: what Oudshoorn and others show is that how humans have decided to classify and give meaning to those physical entities has changed over time, culture, and space. The authors' assertion that athletic differences between men and women can be attributed to biology is false: historical evidence shows that they are driven by social differences in expectations of men and women in sports, ideologies around masculinity and femininity, and training. \"Assigned sex at birth\" isn't a euphemism or politesse: it's an accurate description of what happens when a medical professional uses visual observation to classify a person into a social category. Hormones, genitals, and gametes are fundamental biological features: sex isn't. It's the authors that are encouraging misconceptions.",

Next the ideologues and bullies get in the game, who use it like a cudgel, largely against people who largely agree with them on matters of policy.  \n\nSo what's the result?  A temporary change in terminology, sure.  Accompanying that is a backlash, where people who have less practice in progressive linguistic revisions resent feeling scolded & maligned.

The norm for human committed relationship is this: love.   And thus, looking back from human development into the diversity of sexual orientation, this binary naming at birth presents a problem.   We are grappling with the reality of what one evolutionary Theologian (Teilhard de Chardin) once called \"individuation\" - who we are as an individual.  We can take thumb prints - and apply them to our technology - and solve identity theft while we are at it.  As we are  all unique by this.  As for the issue of our sexual identity, we have the problem of binary patriarchal order and control running through our biggest religion and industry - sports.   What we are observing in our political right - is patriarchal push back and control.  For patriarchy depends on handing down power and money in binary family lines.  But it is also destroying our entire  planet with its' binary bifurcations that cannot see the created order around us and its' well being essential to our well being.  So, you have put your finger on a problem that needs much more reflection and thought.  So - I offer the idea of \"individuation\" - a simple thumb print for one's unique identity at birth.

The real problem is this: our imprecise use of language around our deepening understanding of sex and gender impacts real people in healthcare settings everyday. The lack of asking the right questions in the right way means providers make medical mistakes. This is what we are working to change. You cannot rely on just asking \"sex\" or just asking \"gender\". You cannot tell by looking at someone what kinds of screenings they need and where. Being a healthcare provider isn't for the faint of heart. They have to ask a lot of clarifying and personal questions and they have to do them in a way that builds trust and transparency so that real patients are honest and open. Patients like my friends and family in the LGBTQ+ community have a lifetime of mistrust and fear built up around the healthcare system.

        "It has long made sense to me that sex and gender are different aspects of identity.  Sex is biologically determined and mostly binary. Gender is a social presentation and self-concept that seems limitlessly fluid.  It's important to protect individuals from discrimination/violence/abuse and provide appropriate care/treatment based on both sex and gender identity. Embracing the co-existence of these two distinct aspects of identity acknowledges that sex is a biological status, while respecting individuals' sense of self and they way they chose to live in the world, even in opposition to social expectations to conform to antiquated gender norms (that are toxic for us all).",
        "The words we use to describe bodies are in no way biologically determined. English hasn\u2019t had a way to distinguish between anatomical sex, gender identity, and gender expression and has used the categories male and female as unified signifiers for all three, despite not being universally unified in individual people. Nobody is arguing that most people\u2019s bodies don\u2019t fit neatly into either of the two categories, though by one controversial expert estimation there are more intersex people in the world than there are redheads. What \u201cassigned x at birth\u201d accurately achieves that \u201cmale or female\u201d doesn\u2019t is that someone assigned male at birth can go on to transition. Transition is often a very physical change to a body. It makes a very significant difference in a person\u2019s life and the ways they fit into society. When we say that ED affects people assigned male at birth, we\u2019re acknowledging that trans women, who are women, exist. That is an accurate description of their social position and there is no universal biological basis for cultural roles, even if in the vast majority of people biology and cultural expectation converge. There are plenty of ways that bodies can differ that we don\u2019t insist change the kind of person someone is. Is it biologically inaccurate if I don\u2019t put people into categories based on whether their earlobes are detached? Of course not. That would be ridiculous.",

But BOTH sex and gender are social categories. It's never entirely up to nature who belongs to a social category\u2014the fact that we codify it using boxes on forms should make that plain enough. Historically, our best contemporary understandings of biology have played a large role in setting parameters of sex categories, but that doesn't make those categories natural kinds.\n\nBut nor is it ever entirely up to individuals whether or not they belong to social categories\u2014even very personal ones. I can claim I'm a Democrat, but if I start wearing ugly red hats and picketing abortion clinics, others will quickly assure me that I'm not.\n\nAs happens periodically with many social categories, some would like to renegotiate how their boundaries are set. But to do so by pretending that another social category (in this case, gender identity) is the more fundamental natural kind is equally counterproductive.\n\nLet's be plain about the fact that this is a dispute over how we form the categories that define our social world. And let's avoid the naturalistic fallacy. Appeals to the ultimate authority of biology are unhelpful to the goal of building just and workable social categories, no matter who is making them.",

There are sex-specific phenotypes associated with certain combinations of sex chromosomes, generally XX or XY, but also XXY etc. Those phenotypes may be modified through medical intervention, like surgery or hormone therapy--this is expressed sex. Gender is a form of sex-adjacent expression that does not involve altering sex-specific phenotypes. Thus, we need a third category of term for expressed sex to allay your concerns with the \"assigned at birth\" terminology.",

        "The term \u201cassigned at birth\u201d did not arise to coddle trans and non-binary people, as the authors of this article suggest. The term originated as a way to distinguish what sex an intersex person was (often arbitrarily) assigned at birth by a medical system that could not abide by a person\u2019s intersex characteristics and felt the need to shove them into one designation or another. I mention this because the history of this phrase is important and while the way we use it has expanded to include trans and gender nonconformity people, its utility remains. The phrase, as I see it, is not a byproduct of softening verbiage around sex, but denotes what a person\u2019s secondary sex characteristics may most closely align to (male or female) for the purposes of discussion while also calling to question the entire practice of those sex assignments by medical system that has made no room for the myriad of sexual and biological diversity that exists amongst human beings. People who tend to hate any changes to language that makes trans and non-binary people more comfortable also pushed back against other phrases that attempt to denote sex without also denoting gender, like \u201cpeople with uteruses/penises\u201d (which I agree can sound clunky and weird), but it\u2019s not our fault that the words we have to describe gender and sex fall short of encompassing the diversity of human experience.",

Scientifically, however, \"assigned\" is potentially problematic. About 1 in 1500 infants is born with some disorder or difference in which development of the sex chromosomes, gonads or sex anatomy is atypical - at which point \"assigned\" becomes a much different issue than it is when development is typical and gender is apparent at birth. These children are often tested to determine their \"correct\" gender; some experience surgery to correct functional issues (not a problem), while others experience surgery to \"assign\" a clear gender (problem - especially as they grow up and may, or may not, agree with the gender they were assigned).\n\nChildren in a community in the Dominican Republic are genetically prone to Guevedoces syndrome, in which they appear female at birth, but develop male genitalia at puberty - an issue that occurs often enough that the society simply accepts it, an attitude the rest of us could learn from, to accept what is, instead of trying to determine it.",

For example, a few hundred years ago, it was normal to bleed a sick patient with leeches or small incisions. \nIn more recent history, it was common for the medical industry to force citizens into their homes and to give them vaccines that were advertised as life savers when, in fact, they were nothing more than another flu shot.\nMy point is Western culture gets things wrong all the time. \nThe idea that sex is a social construct and people can assign themselves a preferential sex like it's a fashion statement is the latest hilarious cultural fever that historians will have a field day with a hundred years from now. \nGender dysphoria is a definite mental condition needing both treatment and respectful empathy.

Likewise, it is hard to understand how we can operate efficiently in medicine and science without relying on clear language. I fully embrace the notion of gender fluidity. Gender goes far beyond biology and is also driven by culture and preference. And yes, I do understand that male/female biology is not 100% perfectly binary. We don't live in a world of platonic forms. . . Nevertheless, there are many, many many examples of clear, consistent biological different. As male I wasn't born with a uterus.

This causes a lot of confusion. \n Culture tends to influence and try to define how a specific person should act and what behavior is or is not appropriate.   I think most individuals recognize that this is an area that changes and evolves over generations, and change will happen whether older generations approve or not.  Not many of us would like to go back to the social norms of our grandparents, I suspect.\nBut arguing whether you have male or female chromosomes is not something that can be debated -- generally speaking -- with a very small number of exceptions.   \n\nThere is a difference between biology and culture.  Saying someone is a \"man\" if they have female genes cannot be supported by the biological facts and will confuse society.  Especially medical society-- a society that is trying to look out for individual health.\nIf, however, one wishes to behave the way one feels is appropriate for a \"man,\" that is a cultural determination.  Behavior that is appropriate for men and for women constantly changes over the generations and likely won't stop now.   It is a messy definition that causes a lot of messy situations.

        "When I was young it was easy to tell who was a boy and who was a girl.  Boys had short hair, girls had long hair.  Boys wore trousers and girls wore dresses or skirts.  If a boy came to school with long hair he was sent home to get it cut, and if a girl came to school in slacks she was sent home to get properly dressed.  In the past, knowing whether a person had a penis would tell you how long that person's hair would be, or what that person would be wearing.  Today some people believe it can tell you what gender that person would identify with or whom they'd be attracted to, or even whether they'd be good at math.\n\nDuring fetal development there are decision points when cells choose whether to make male or female genitalia, whether the brain will identify as male or female, whether the brain will find males or females attractive, whether the brain will be good at math or poetry, and so on.  Each of these decisions is made based on the concentration of specific chemicals in the relevant cells at the relevant time, and each decision is made independently.  Usually the chemical concentrations lead to decisions which we would traditionally consider consistent, but that doesn't always happen, so genitalia, gender identity, gender attraction and other brain traits are not always correlated.  If 'sex' is assigned based on genitalia then that should be the extent of attributes assigned to that individual.  It's not even clear whether sex, as a cultural trait, has much meaning.",

While it\u2019s true that language is just a method of communication, it is also an incredibly powerful one. And this entire article is an attack on trans validity in its entirety. Because this whiny nitpicking of language is undermining the truth that trans people deserve the fundamental right to live as the people that they ARE. And it robs you of NOTHING to allow trans people to simply live their lives. And when you attack the language people use to describe their identities, you are attacking their identities, and you are encouraging others to do the same. The fact that as far as I can see, not a single person has commented anything to truly question this article is so deeply disappointing.

The conceptual separation of sex and gender was a major victory for compassion and acceptance, but the existence of ambiguity threw a wrench into the works. It was going to be so simple, right?  Sex would refer to biology and gender would refer to identity.  \n\nFirst, am I wrong that that was ever the widely held intent (and that failure to account for ambiguous genitalia is why this became so problematic)?  If I'm not wrong, couldn't we expand sex to include three biological categories (M / F / A (ambiguous)) with the understanding that anyone eligible for \"A\" is always free to select M or F if they prefer. \n\nMy sense is that this would be received as problematic because it would force some people to either chose an ill-fitting M or F or else live with a possibly stigmatized A.  I would agree that this is seriously problematic, but is there really a better alternative?  \n\nI can see how the idea of ditching the concept of biological sex in favor of a host of gender categories would feel attractive, mostly because the gender terms are currently \"owned\" by allies.

At its simplest: male and female describe the body; masculine and feminine describe  characteristics and qualities of the person.\n\nPerhaps, if we lived in a culture where the binary was not so revered, we might have a language which embraced and described as \"normal\" the continuum of human sex, gender, character,  and which did not favor some over others, and which, therefore, provided a place for everyone, so that these arguments over terms like male and female would be moot.",

It seems like a small thing, but we don't live in our bodies.  We are our bodies.  To live in a body gives the impression that your \"self\" is somehow separate from your body.

        "Hmm. Too many comments to discern if the following has already been observed. The opinion of the authors leaves a glaring hole which is recognizing that the question in a medical setting of \"sex\" (the noun, not the verb) serves an informational/medical/treatment purpose, and  it's important that people answer correctly (esp. since they may not themselves realize the significance of the medical/treatment angle).  In order to achieve higher accuracy in response, Sex Assigned at Birth, leaves very little room for an answer to be wrong. Whereas asking the sex question could leave at least some room for the respondent to miss the cues of a medical setting, and put the question through a different filter, giving an answer that is problematic for treatment.  So, why the fuss?  If we can improve the accuracy of answers of significance on a medical form, by all means, let's do that. If it happens to also add a degree of politeness and lower a barrier to patient/provider openness, well, heck, take that as a win. The rest is really petty argument that ignores core purpose.",

This notion of an endlessly open horizon for interpretation of identity/being has become alienating for a wide majority, ironically not helping the cause of those who actually are different. While it may be the case that 1.7%-3% of the population have chromosomal differences that make the clarity of their gender difficult to parse, making everyone else be \"identified as\" instead of \"is.\" To be told in recent years that instead of being female or a woman, in reality I'm a just \"person with a uterus\" or a \"birth-capable person\" disenfranchises me from so much of what being a woman encompasses.",

I'm merely purchasing a paintbrush, a bottle of wine, bandages, or underwear.\n\nSo what is the purpose of gender identity? The authors list all the basic reasons but it is really a defense of our current organization flow chart. \n\nBut it also seems to be needed to perpetuate discrimination of people.  Take \"to each his own\", \"to each her own\", \"to each their own\". Why is that so hard to understand? Get over it.\n\nA doctor and/or pharmacist can merely say for example:  \"This medication may cause your future unborn child to experience a disability\"....therefore sex for procreation should be reconsidered\" or \"too much alcohol will ruin your health, faster if you were born a female\"... therefore stick to the wine aisle and leave the bourbon to those born a male\".\n\nYes, very simplistic.

        "Agreed.  A transgender person is still male or female regardless of their gender expression.  Also using terms like \"pregnant people\" and other such euphemisms is imprecise and simply wrong if it is meant to include men.  A woman by definition can give birth; a man cannot.  If you identify as a transgender man, you can still be female, a woman, a mother, and you still have or had the organs needed to give birth.

        "Why does it feel like the NYT has an anti-trans/nonbinary opinion column quota that they're trying to fill?  It gets tiresome seeing my family get attacked on a biweekly basis.\n\nThe \"assigned\" language is used because in everyday language, \"male/female\" can refer to either sex or gender, so you need an additional qualifier to remove ambiguity.  \"Biological male/female\" is unsatisfying because many trans/nonbinary people would assert that they are biologically their chosen gender, since biology includes their brain.  Their biology tells them they are not the gender assigned at birth.  \n\n\"Chromosomal male/female\" seems like it would be fine to me.  But my nonbinary kid likes using \"assigned female at birth,\" so I'm happy to follow their lead.\n\nPeople like to decry this evolving language as bending over backwards for a tiny minority.  But nearly 6% of Gen Z identifies as trans or nonbinary (which is close to the percentage of US adults who are Asian Americans).  A significant minority who should not be ignored.  \n\nThe number identifying as trans/nonbinary has increased for younger generations as the stigma and discrimination has decreased, but likely is still an undercount given the amount of discrimination and bias that persists (such as in these opinion pages).  It wouldn't surprise me if the true number in 20 years ends up being around the 10% of people who are left handed (a number that was also much smaller back when lefties were more discriminated against).",

Even at the gene level, sex is not binary.  That is all hogwash.\n\nThis article is one in the now long line of the Times granting a loudspeaker to people engulfed in an anti-Transgender panic.  We are not in danger of not knowing that men and women are different because we recognize that neither sex nor gender fits in two distinct silos.",
