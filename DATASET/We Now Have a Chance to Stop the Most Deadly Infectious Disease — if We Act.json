        "Yet the upper very educated class of India, come to the state and game the system,  here. Often they own some of the best real estate, and business's.  I've  know and have observed plenty of play acting while  they reside in their Almaden Valley homes, go off to Hawaii & vacation in their relatives Tahoe estates.  Yet have their students, and family members on government assistance. \n\nWhen is the upper class going to be held responsible; in that very corrupt country?    What suddenly the U.S.tax payers , are being asked to finance health care for India?  \nI'm thinking what; \" so corporate America, and international companies can still have a reliable supply of cheap labor from a third world country?\"",

The vaccine was mandatory even though the rate of success wasn't great. Back in the States and for a long time, she tested positive to TB because of the vaccine and had proof of the vaccine. Her Xrays were negative. I don't know if the BCG has improved since then.",

        "Well, the fact the we have TB under control in the United States is thanks to earlier efforts on public health.  We failed with COVID and with HIV.  We fail in many ways when it comes to health care in the United States.  One reason is because its success is invisible.  If people don't get TB because of effective public health policies all our politicians see is dollar signs.  \n\nI'm worried about the rise and spread of childhood diseases that had been under control.  Measles, rubella, mumps, pertussis all of which have vaccines.  These vaccines are effective and they prevent illnesses.  The anti vaccine crowd don't want to believe that for their own reasons.  They've never seen what can happen if a child develops complications from measles or what pertussis can do to an infant.  \n\nTB worries me too but not in the same way.  If it were rampant here I'm sure we'd find a way not to deal with it appropriately.  After all, we didn't want to wear masks when it was advisable.",
        "How is it possible that public health is now under relentless attack, when it so obviously benefits society overall? Thank the self-serving demagogues and the neo-liberal profiteers with their libertarian, anti-social gospel of toxic individualism. We collectively failed the COVID test. I shudder to think what happens when an even more virulent communicable disease like H5N1 influenza strikes. And TB? It will continue to devour the poor and the marginalized until the wealthy run out of money or their drugs no longer work (MDR-TB, XDR-TB) and they too will experience the resurgence of this ancient scourge.

Take the social darwinist types, with their assuption of genetic superiority and their, \u201cwhy are we trying to stop these deaths, there are too many poor kids anyway,\u201d routine. Who cares that the only proven way to cut family sizes is to improve nutrition, education, and public health?\n\nOr take the isolationist types, who apparently live in a world without airplanes. CANNOT get them to understand that societies with immense poverty and lousy public health don\u2019t just breed newer and better disease: they breed social collapse, crazy government, terrorism, crime and refugees. People aren\u2019t knocking on our southern door just for funsies, folks. \n\nBestest of all, Gawande\u2019s asking for chump change.

Everyone assumes they have the right to do what they want no matter the consequences to others. Just the simple act of masking was too much. Aided by ignorant demogogues seeking power, they dug their own graves. I can recall a time when TB patients who refused treatment were confined; hard to imagine that now.\n Our lack of public spirit and willingness to comprise and sacrifice for the greater good as shown by those who fought WWII will be our undoing.

        "I grew up in Norfolk MA and later worked at a state cancer hospital as an RN called Pondville. It originally was a TB hospital. Later in life I visited Zamborano hospital which was in the northwest (now under the umbrella of Eleanor Slater hospital complex in Rhode Island).  It too was a former TB hospital. \nSo in living memory, there were TB hospitals all over this country at one time.  \nSome of the nurses in Pondville had been given an inoculation against TB.  Is that still possibility?  I had to be tested routinely for TB but she couldn't get the Tine Test because hers would automatically be positive.  The immunization had exposed her to the disease so she had antibodies. \n\nA last thought is how much people in Europe suffered and died from TV.  It affected the poor mostly, who lived in close corners and had bad nutrition.  A recently diseased neighbor (age 99) and friend, lost her mother to TB so the memory of the ravages of TB live on.",
        "When we say \u201cdeadliest,\u201d we\u2019ll want to narrow our meaning sense. The Ebola Zaire virus is about the most certain to lead to death if you get it, up to 90% mortality within ten days of symptom onset. Influenza together with its secondary bacterial invaders probably kills the most people. But few are likely to get Ebola. People almost always recover quickly and completely from flu if in good health. Tuberculosis is a chronic infection that remains encapsulated as cysts in the lungs after recovery from an acute bout. The cysts, called \u201ctubercles,\u201d are visible on chest X-rays and give the disease its name. These can reactivate at any time with stress, malnutrition or aging, even many years later. The cysts are why it\u2019s so hard for treatment to clear TB. Months of antibiotics specific to this organism are required, and some polydrug-resistant strains are incurable.\n\nIn Europe, it was called the \u201cwhite death,\u201d shortening lives as famous as that of Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who proved that extracting roots of polynomials of degree >4 algebraically is in general impossible before succumbing to TB at age 26.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely in the US interest to limit TB in India. Antibiotic resistance is evolving there, and airline service joins the countries. We already have TB here in homeless and drug-using populations, jails and prisons. Once TB becomes entrenched in a population, management and reduction of new cases is much harder.",

And with creativity by communicators, a viable political message? (Remember the Peace Corps and the excitement about it from that era.)\nBut skeptics may say: \"Americans just don't care about such issues,\" like malaria. It doesn't affect them. Helping poor kids in India with malaria doesn't make American lives better.\nAre the skeptics right?\nAlso, Dr. Gawande, you've used the word \"Innovation\" twice. Beyond just this issue, and relevant to all of your agency's work, are you sure you're innovating as much as you think you are?\nHave you seriously looked at candidates for USAID jobs without traditional backgrounds in health or development, but are continuous social innovators in ways you and your resume-screeners don't know you don't know?",
        "India is an over-populated country and the congested slums in big cities transmitting TB are the result of \u201cunwanted fertility \u201c in rural areas of the Northern states. India needs to focus on sustainable development rather than trying to be a manufacturing hub because of resource constraints such as groundwater depletion. USAID should subsidize high quality healthcare and family planning services for reducing population growth in many countries.",
        "We have a reflexive position that every life should be saved.\n\nThe question of allocating resources to preserve a life versus using those resources to improve the quality of multiple lives is stigmatized.\n\nIn a world seething with humanity living at the margins, with the environmental costs that are a byproduct of human activities ever more apparent, the quality versus quantity issue deserves more of our attention.\n\nBut our irrationality runs deep. For example, in Afghanistan you have a country that is as completely dysfunctional as it gets and Doctors Without Borders are dedicated to maintaining hospital service for pregnant women.\n\nOn the face of it, people will say that to criticize that is monstrous. And it may well be. But you can't escape the fact that they are simply bringing more people into a world that cannot feed itself now, and that real mercy would center around preventing pregnancies.",
        "Amazing news! Thank you, Dr. Gawande. As a lung and ICU physician, I often have to tell patients with curable or treatable diseases, like diabetes, \u201cAt least your condition has a treatment; I can\u2019t say that for all my patients with terminal illnesses.\u201d\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a disease that falls into the treatable category. It\u2019s not lack of medical solutions, but politics and public health neglect that stand in the way of treating it effectively.\n\nDr. Gawande, though a surgeon (and they are great!), truly understands that by raising awareness and working on issues like TB, he\u2019s helping to save countless young lives and improve quality of life for many more. Thank you for your impactful work!",

The damage to these organs remains and often progresses even though the TB infection has been eradicated. The burden of post-TB disease does not presently enter into WHO estimates of the global TB problem. Although no TB treatments currently address this problem, prevention of post-TB disease is the subject of several innovative clinical trials of host-directed therapies that hold substantial promise.",

Previously, I had visited about 20 locked adult women's facilities in the US. (The rates of identified TB among the populations (only a tiny percentage are tested for TB) was between 4-6 %. There were no functional isolation rooms in these detention centers.\nDetention, prison, jail etc are (where the poor are crowded together and often medically neglected) are petri dishes for infectious and communicable diseases right here in the US.",
        "One of the many big barriers to eradicating TB is that treatment is unpleasant and lasts for many months. Critically, incomplete chemotherapy for an infectious disease such as TB can result in drug-resistant strains that are unmatched by our slow TB drug development, greatly worsening the problem.\n\nI'm a privileged person who underwent many months of treatment for active TB. It was an extreme experience: 2 months of isolation, heavy-duty drugs, an emergency visit for hepatitis caused by said drugs, and daily public health monitoring to make sure I was taking those meds. I was fortunate enough to have a job that allowed me to take time off, friends to bring me food, and access to scientific information about the disease and current treatments. I can't imagine what it would have been like without having these resources.\n\nReducing TB burden in low-resource areas must also focus on supporting individuals and their families so that they are able to complete the arduous treatment course. This is a huge but essential task to save lives and prevent TB drug resistance.",

        "Wow!  Tuberculosis, the most prominent and frequent infectious disease world-wide, beyond AIDS and Malaria; fortunately, nowadays, treatable by having more affordable medications and early screening, and financial assistance. I remember, as a medical student in Bolivia in the 1960's, every third patient in our public hospital had TB; and although isoniazide and streptomycine were available, they were scant and expensive while the population most affected was poor, miners in \"early retirement\" from exhaustion, with silico-tuberculosis, dying in groves and nothing much we could do to extend their shortened life. Bolivian tin mines were exploited by having the Natives use explosives, and then, before the silica in the air could settle, they would run in to carry the mineral, as they were paid by the amount they brought out. Awful, you say? Absolutely!",
        "My partner got TB from contact with a truck driver in Denmark while visiting friends. He frequently drove in Greenland where TB is rampant.  She didn't know she had it for 6 months. Treatment took two years, caused weight gain and numerous other side effects. It was a type of TB that wasn't transmission to others but will always be in her  body.  It seems because she wasn't  part of a marginalized population several doctors never caught it.  She's fine now but she was in her 20s when it happened so it had a significant impact on her being able to participate in normal activities.  Greenland and Indigenous connunities in the Canafian north have high rates of TB still because of poverty and squalid living conditions due to significant government underfunding of their communities.",
        "My parents, born in 1914, had several peers who got TB.  When my mom became a public health nurse, she saw a lot of it in crowded tenements.  When she had children in the 1940's and 1950's, she was highly vigilant about avoiding, and having us avoid, people who seemed to have TB symptoms.  At that time, even if you survived TB, you would lose months or years of your life to the treatment, and be barred from many occupations because you would always test positive.",

        "I asked Gemini, Google's AI chatbot about how climate change can contribute to TB infections. Here's the response.\n\n\"Climate change doesn't directly cause TB infections, but it creates conditions that increase the risk and spread of the disease. Here's how:\n\nDisplacement and Overcrowding: Extreme weather events like floods, droughts, and storms can force people to leave their homes, leading to overcrowding in refugee camps and urban slums. These conditions are ideal for TB transmission. \u00a0 \n\nWeakened Immune Systems: Malnutrition, a common consequence of climate-related disasters, weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to TB. \u00a0 \n\nEconomic Disruption: Climate change can disrupt economies, leading to poverty and reduced access to healthcare. This can hinder TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts.\n\nEnvironmental Factors: Some studies suggest that changes in temperature and humidity might influence the survival of TB bacteria in the environment, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nIn essence, climate change acts as a catalyst, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.\"",
