        "A terrible article, I still don't know what the point was. What I do know is that you can get people to say something positive, or not damming, on any subject, think smoking, asbestos, lead and sports betting, which confuses the issue enough and together with political lobbying leads to no positive action. The politicians stay elected the people suffer the companies make more money.",
        "I think that most people know by now - fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, chicken good; soda, McDonalds, blue sports drinks, cookies, candy, not so good.

        "My mom is 101 years old, born in 1923. Her father died at 94. Mom and grandpa grew up eating mostly unprocessed food until the 50's cause there was little processed food before the 50's. Then a mix of the two for years. Still that mix with mom, collard and kale greens cooked with some pork, fried fish, sweet and white potatoes, store bought bread, baked and fried chicken, baked salmon, etc. A variety of stuff. I'm coming to the conclusion that makes the most sense both from an enjoyment and health standpoint. Mom figured it out.",
        "If a food makes me want more of it, no matter how much of it I eat, and the more I eat of it the less satisfied I feel, then I\u2019m not going to pick up the first bite of that food and I\u2019m not going to keep it in the house. It\u2019s as simple as that.  Quitting over-engineered food reminds me a lot of quitting drinking.",

Then the distribution system. \n\nIf we allowed the earth's natural capacity to feed us flourish instead of trying to replace it for a profit, I'll bet things would be different. But instead we get seeds from plants grown to resist pesticides that kill us with cancer, paid off experts to say it's not true, and a whole army of enablers that make it easy and cheaper to just get the processed foods with additives that are ready to eat with minimal preparation and chemical substitutes for nutrition added. \n\nWhat would you expect from such a system?",

        "The ultra-processed foods I eat aren't all that bad, I believe, because I do the ultra-processing myself. For example, when I come home with a potato, depending on how I want to eat it, it may be minimally processed, or ultra-processed. \n\nMinimally, I microwave it until it's cooked through, and eat it with butter and salt.\n\nHowever, I may decide to process it with a series of steps:\n1. washing the potato\n2. cutting the potato into consistent size pieces.\n3. applying heat for a time to cook the product.\n4. adding sodium chloride as a flavor enhancer\n5. adding Piper nigrum (processed by grinding)\n6. adding a dairy product containing some animal fat for flavor and texture.\n7. mashing the ingredients to form a smooth product.\n8. refrigerating the product to make it stiff for shaping\n9. shape the product into bite-sized balls\n10. coat the balls with stale bread that has been processed by grinding into crumbs.\n11.

        "Perspective is important. My hip friends turned up their noses at the processed orange juice provided by the WIC program, but when I worked on an Indian reservation, my work on dental and nutritional education led the school kids to start drinking it instead of a morning Coke or Pepsi. The WIC oj was much better for them, and it led to the manager of the local store complaining that pop sales had dropped. I considered it a successful effort. That said, the natural and less processed, the better.",

The author uses a lot of words to say that basically - in an ideal world, unprocessed whole foods are best. \n\nRFK scares me deeply but a broken clock is right twice a day, and he\u2019s not wrong about ultraprocessed foods. We lose credibility fighting that battle. And while unprocessed foods is currently not the most realistic/cost effective/efficient option, maybe stricter regulations can change that. This is one issue we can all get behind.",
        "The key sentences are: The problem is that the category of ultraprocessed foods, which makes up about 60 percent of the American diet by some estimates, is so broad that it borders on useless. It lumps store-bought whole-grain bread and hummus in with cookies, potato chips and soda.\" I am a great believer in the Mediterranean diet, DASH, I bake my own whole-wheat bread, etc., etc., but I find the definitions used for \"ultraprocessed\" include many healthy or at least reasonably healthy foods that simply have complicated ingredients (a bit of an oxymoron) but are over all good for us.",
        "The author makes good points concerning the wide variety of ultraprocessed foods, some of which fit into a healthy diet.  Think of canned tomatoes, canned beans, whole wheat bread, etc.  I could say I make most of my food at home but if the food is high in fat, starch and sugar, this is not health food and will most likely cause weight gain.\nIt would be helpful if fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats were both more affordable, easier to prepare and more available to the general population, especially lower income consumers.",
        "I wonder why Guess writes \"well-to-do\" parents make their own bread. Bread is very cheap and easy to make, and takes a few hours that many people have on the weekends or after work, and you can even leave it overnight and bake in the morning. It's not a \"well-to-do\" thing to make your own bread. I've been doing it for years, and so did my mom and her mom, all working class folks.",
        "I\u2019ve found that chemical additives in bread and some pastries - some of which that are banned in Europe - to be very unhealthy. I\u2019ve switched to bread with no preservatives, and I\u2019m much happier with my diet. So for me, it\u2019s not the processing, it\u2019s the chemical additives to be wary of. I think the Europeans banned these additives for a good reason, why can\u2019t the USA do this too?",
        "One rarely mentioned, inconvenient truth: without processed foods, we would be relying entirely on highly perishable foods to supply the entire caloric needs of a population of hundreds of millions of people in the USA.\n\nThat means we would always be living on the razor's edge of famine. Any major disruption to food supply (weather, war, pandemic, etc.)...and we'd have mass starvation.",
        "Real food cooked at home is much less expensive than highly processed food. Rice, beans, chicken, pork, pasta, legumes. BTW, don't believe for one second that you are saving the world by eating sodium rich ultra processed veggie burgers. Simply make your own.",
        "Based on my degree in Anthropology and education related to evolution and the rise of humans, I have concluded the best dietary approach is to only eat substances that are found in nature.  In other words, if our distant ancestors ate it and if it's a naturally occurring food in our environment, then it's probably healthy to eat.  There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and even healthy foods consumed to excess can have negative consequences.  But if one follows this rule of thumb in a common sense way, they are likely to be eating a healthy diet.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s so agonizingly nearly impossible to boil some oats or brown rice while zoning out on insta and TikTok while the kids are playing violent video games in the other room and dad is where? And washing and cutting a couple of vegetables? My granny managed that on her own well into her late seventies. \n\nAnd it\u2019s definitely easier to get in the car and drive to Starbucks to get your quote coffee unquote and a few hundred calories of industrial gunk than to make your own when you get up in the morning. I tell you, that two minutes it takes to make that fresh cup and the minute and a half it takes to clean up, it\u2019s like being waterboarded. I\u2019d rather drive five each way so I can bully some unfortunate barista.",
        "The real problem is that people are just enjoying their food too much. If it was all just harder to eat, and didn't taste as good, obesity wouldn't be a problem. How about a tax on tastiness?",
        "People in rural areas tend to live longer than those in big cities, they might not eat gourmet foods, but they don't suffer from  stress levels which has lots to do with living longer. The last funeral I went to the fellow was 99 years old. And many people here live till a ripe old age and many with out terrible diseases. So stress has a lot to do with what happens to our bodies as much as our food.",
        "Do grade schools teach cooking any more?  If all anyone knows about food preparation is heating things in a microwave they can't be expected to prepare food from scratch.  It doesn't take much longer to prepare a meal from scratch than to preheat an oven for a frozen dinner, if it's done reasonably.  Marinating meat just means taking a minute to put it into a sealable plastic bag or other container with the marinade and putting it in the refrigerator.  And it's a lot cheaper.",
        "A mix of economic, cultural, environmental, and social factors, along with things like marketing, emotional influences, personal preferences, and time constraints, all play a role in why people might avoid eating fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes.",

        "Store bought fresh vegetables are not the same quality as home grown vegetables, often bland and tasteless. Depending on where you buy them they don\u2019t keep well.\nThat said, we recently bought a new, relatively expensive refrigerator that does an excellent job of keeping our green stuff fresh.",
        "Ultraprocessed bread is bad. It is sometimes worse than cookies. Many of the ingredients used are unrecognizable by the body and should not be allowed. Many of them are unnecessary, but are used for marketing appeal or to cut costs. Many of these are not allowed in other countries and there is bread available on the shelves without all these engineered ingredients.",

The experts felt that there wasn\u2019t enough reliable science to draw accurate conclusions.\" \nNo surprise here at all. It's political. The junk food industry has powerful lobbyists. This really isn't hard to understand or do implement nutrition guidelines that made scientific sense. It's lack of political will. \n\nAlso, breakfast cereals and yogurt can be extremely unhealthy!!! Sweetened yogurts are of sugar as are many cereals! The author's industry bias is showing...",

        "This is the perfect story for our times: real food is too expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to cook for most people, and while we know our food delivery system is deadly we\u2019re powerless to do anything against the corporations in charge. We can even afford to vote with our pocketbooks. \n\nInstead, we quibble over the labeling.",
        "Beware red herrings\u2026.\nHow many people in the US work three jobs, like the taxi driver and the single parent in this story?  The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that about 5.3% of 161 MM total workers have more than one job.  None of these is more than two jobs.  There is no three jobs category, because the number is vanishingly small.  The number of people who work two jobs has actually decreased by 20% since 2010.  Yet the author tells us that due to the number of people who slave at three jobs - it follows that we rely on the convenience of junk food\u2026Whew!\n\nSo, yes, theoretically we could all jump up and down and decide no society should ever have people work three jobs, but that really would NOT MOVE THE NEEDLE AT ALL.  This is what\u2019s called a red herring and it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the shocking obesity epidemic and the dire medical state this country\u2019s obese people are in.  \n\nBlaming ultra-processed food is also a red herring.  \nYou could eat a diet made up of UPF and never gain a pound.  You could be very healthy.  Of course, you could also become obese and unhealthy.  The common denominator is YOU and YOUR personal choices and if they include copious amounts of fat, sugar and carbs you are going in the wrong direction.",

        "Well this is a commentary on the state of science. We now have a defensive scientist connecting with the busy populace of the world and making excuses about why ultra processed foods may not be that bad. If a taxi driver is hungry at 2 am why not suggest he pick up a bag of nuts? The whole article is pointless. Everyone is aware that we need to eat healthy and what constitutes \u2018real\u2019 food. The problem is the enormous availability and seduction by ultra processed foods that attracts children and most of the populace who opt for easy over healthy. With millions being made by the cereal industry why not label them kinda healthy in the absence of personal time and effort. It sure appears that researchers have been lost to the dark side and are equally responsible alongside big corporations for the bad choices made by people. The war cry by RFK is quite welcome. His unfortunate war against all vaccines is an unfortunate accompaniment to otherwise better advice on the food front.",

        "I identify as someone who makes the best efforts to eat whole foods and follow seasons. In fact, most of the people of my millennial generation seem to be striving to grow our own food, raise chickens, support local. But when I observe my mom, and the more average American diet, I come off as a snob for not being a fan of microwaved vegetables or instant rice. But the food industries have mastered the art of giving Americans what they want- a ton of food that tastes \"good\" for as little money as possible. It's the American mindset- we want to have everything and pay nothing for it. Until we can collectively grow up and accept that we have to put our money where our mouth is *gold star pun*, we will keep talking in circles.",

You don't have to have a Ph.D. in nutrition to know that Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs aren't the healthiest breakfast foods available.\n\nThe issue of what counts as an \"ultraprocessed food\" certainly is important to academics who do research on the topic, and who must devise reasonable operational definitions of what they're studying.\n\nBut for most of us laypeople---at least those who give a hoot and who aren't in denial on the subject---it's reasonably clear what the bad kinds of ultraprocessed food are.

Even she admits that her diet consists of \"lots of fruits and vegetables and lean protein.\" Well, yeah. That's what most who can, and care, eat. But the marketing budget for Big Carrot might not be as big as Beyond Meat.\n\nSeveral of her points seem unconvincing or frankly suspect to me. For example, she says that yogurt is an ultraprocessed food. Well it depends on whom you ask, but generally, plain unsweetened yogurt, is not. Yogurt full of sugar and processed fruit, is. She says that supermarket bread isn't any worse than homemade bread. But 99.99% of supermarket breads contain sugar -- not to mention a bunch of other random chemicals -- which most traditional bread recipe don't. She claims that \"breakfast cereals\" are healthy. Well, sure, oatmeal is. Cap'n Crunch? No chance.\n\nHer point that time crunches and costs make a big impact on people's healthy choices rings true.

Nearly every non-starchy vegetable accomplishes this.

Sometimes they should think more broadly - Gogurt is not really good for you, for example. But generally speaking, if it has a better shelf life than broccoli, you can assume it's worse for you.

Let's quickly examine a couple. \n\nThe author cites a study where half of participants ate ultra processed foods, and the other half whole foods, but where both diets included the same amount of sugar and salt. It's inclusion here has to be a misuse of the study since one of the key arguments against ultra processed foods is that they are loaded up with unnecessary sugar and salt!

I've been hearing this argument about bread as the conversation around ultra processed foods evolves; store-bought bread is processed and has whole grains, so processing food can't be bad! It's a wildly reductive and misleading argument. Yes, whole grains contain important nutrients that milled, white flour does not, but that does not mean any dish with a whole grain is 'healthy.' In fact, it's overly simple to think of foods as either 'healthy' or 'unhealthy.' Different foods provide different nutrients that our bodies need.

There are reasonably healthy baked products, but so many of these products even with organic whole grains have unhealthy amounts of sugar, fat and salt.\n\nSay no to marketing influences on our food choices. Let's eat as healthy as possible, mostly organic vegetables and fruits, healthy proteins, and limited carbs. It's is worth it.",
        "\"Homemade fries or cookies probably aren\u2019t all that much healthier than the ultraprocessed, store-bought versions.\"\n\nIs this actually true, though? \n\nI took a closer look and it seems like homemade is better, at least for the one item I looked at.\n\nI looked at a muffin featured in that NIH ultra-processed food study mentioned at the top of the article. It appears in one of the breakfast options given to the \"processed foods\" experiment group. The muffin is an Otis Spunkmeyer individually-wrapped blueberry muffin, and it has 32 grams of sugar added. \n\nI looked up a homemade blueberry muffin recipe online (the first google result for it) and it asks for 3/4 cups of white sugar to make a dozen muffins. That's about 150 grams, but divided among 12 muffins. So, about 12.5 grams of sugar per muffin.\n\nOr, put another way, the prepackaged muffin has 2.5x more sugar than the homemade muffin. That's a huge increase. The homemade muffin should be meaningfully better for you, right?\n\n(And why does the individually packaged muffin have so much extra sugar? As mentioned in the article: Shelf life. We should be super wary of eating anything bread-like that can live on a shelf for a year without going bad. Probably, it has too much sugar.)",

For example, here the author lumps all types of store-bought bread to make her point that not all UPF is bad. This is a classical example in obfuscation: where you buy the bread is not the issue. The issue is whether the bread consists of 4 ingredients: flour, water, salt and yeast or whether it is full of additives that humans beings have never used as food. It is the additives that cause the damage, not where it was made. Also, to say that butter is unhealthy is misleading. Butter contains essential amino acids and consumed with yogurt and fruits is quite healthy.\n\nAs the book Ultra Processed People shows the only research that consistently does not link UPF to poor health is the research produced by the UPF industry. Surprise of surprises. \n\nThe sad thing is that we are on our own in this fight.

The NuCal system is based on the degree to which a serving of food meets a person's daily nutrient needs, compared to the caloric space the serving of food takes up. The impact of processing is best and most simply measured by the % of nutrients in a serving of a food product that come from the raw food ingredients required to make the serving, plus the % of nutrients in a serving of food from ingredients other than the raw foods used to manufacture the serving.

        "The flawed logic of this piece makes me think that the author doesn't actually believe what they are saying, and earns a living from making bad arguments about food.\n\nFor one, they seem to imply that the taxi driver has to start preparing their meal at 2 a.m., which is just absurd.\n\nIf they can microwave a frozen meal at 2 a.m., they can also microwave anything else they\u2019ve cooked for themselves in the past week.\n\nThis is such a cop out (for both the author and the hypothetical taxi driver!)\n\nBasic cooking skills, a modestly stocked pantry and spice drawer, some pre-planning and a little creativity can take one very, very far toward a more delicious, nourishing, varied and, importantly, affordable diet.",
        "Maybe the ultra processed food companies should be properly regulated and we should disallow ingredients that cause issues. This industry should turn to making better and safer products. I feel sad about the fact that because many of these products are easily available and cheap that many people use them (and some cannot afford better). Our unregulated environment hurts us in countless ways. And these \u201cfoods\u201d cause expensive medical problems. Regulation is not the evil that Republicans say it is. Look at Europe. There is a lot we can learn from Europe",
        "So many issues with this article it\u2019s hard to know where to start, but I will go with the positive and that is the overall message that ultra processed foods are bad for you.  They taste too good and we overeat. (And it\u2019s just not that difficult for busy or low income folks to eat less processed foods - several commenters have provided examples already.)\n\nI would guess that reductions of anything bad for you has more to do with a concerted, cross sectional messaging effort to inform people of the hazards and somehow incorporating shame into continuing with the behavior. Think of seat belt utilization in the US. The difference is that there is no one benefiting from NOT using seat belts so there is no opposing message occurring,  \n\nGive the US food industry time and they will develop, new healthier products for people, then their messaging will change, and coupled with government messaging, behaviors will change. Taxes may give the government more of our money, but there are plenty of caveats to thinking taxes are changing usage.",
        "But first you have to overcome the sugar industry, meat industry, agriculture industry, et al. They have a very vetted interest in keeping Americans fat and sassy. People know what is healthy or unhealthy but don\u2019t care, they\u2019re Americans! They know there\u2019s a pill or an injection to save them from their bad habits. Maybe we should charge obese people more for health insurance like we do smokers. Actually thank a smoker! They may more in taxes and insurance to support obesity.",
        "To be clear, this word jumble gibberish of an opinion piece doesn\u2019t support the notion that ultra-processed foods \u201caren\u2019t always bad\u201d, it simply states that we don\u2019t often know. Because there has been no research. Which is because there\u2019s no economic incentive to find out or to actually make people healthier, but rather the opposite.",
        "I asked my chat \"About taxes such as the soda tax, what would a tax look like that taxed a finished product based on how many ingredients where within the product\"\n\n   * A government agency would need to define what constitutes an \"ingredient.\" This could be a complex task, especially for processed foods with many additives and complex manufacturing processes.\n   * Ingredients could be categorized by type (e.g., natural, artificial, processed) or by their role in the product (e.g., flavoring, coloring, preservative).\n * Tax Calculation:\n   * A formula would be established to calculate the tax based on the number and/or type of ingredients. For example:\n     * A base tax for a certain number of core ingredients.\n     * Additional taxes for each additional ingredient beyond the base.\n     * Higher taxes for certain types of ingredients... (continued)",
        "Nutrition science is junk science. Period, full stop. Aside from certain pathological facts, e.g., that a lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, nutritionists and dietitians have very little advice to offer: Eat a balanced diet, avoid processed foods. These are meaningless platitudes. \"Balanced\" and \"processed\" cannot be defined precisely, so there's no way to test any hypothesis associated with them. \n\nOf course, everyone knows what these terms really mean: \"balanced\" corresponds to whatever diet is currently fashionable (low fat, high fiber, low carb, high protein, vegan, vegetarian, no sugar, etc.), and \"processed\" -- which wasn't scary enough, so they had to invent \"ultraprocessed\" -- means any food they don\u2019t like, or that is produced for profit by greedy, soulless corporations.",
        "More ridiculous saturated fat demonization, exactly the type of nutrition advice that got us in this health crisis to begin with. I wasn't surprised at all when I read at the bottom of the article that the author has been a consultant for food companies, including Beyond Meat. Can't we finally have 3rd party INDEPENDENT nutrition research that hasn't been tainted by corporate incentives?",
        "As a consultant for Beyond Meat, an extremely Frankenfood, the author\u2019s opinions should transact at a very high discount.",
        "Just don't eat anything with ingredients your grandmother wouldn't recognize.",
        "The author does not define \u201cultraprocessed\u201d and does not distinguish it from \u201cprocessed.\u201d   I didn\u2019t notice any discussion of additives, such as food dyes and preservatives.  \n    In college I lived on ramen and cheap boxes of Mac and cheese.  Neither has any nutritional content.  When it came to vegetables, occasionally a minced an onion.  Today, I have type II diabetes off and on, because I don\u2019t exercise.  \n      Whole grains like brown rice with the husk attached and quinoa are seemingly not processed, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should be the basis of your diet.  \n     But if you\u2019re a consultant to the food \u201cindustry\u201d you might want to keep your job by encouraging people to eat food that comes in boxes, cans, and plastic bags.",
        "Quite frankly, I have no interest in taking advice from scientists who advise regulatory agencies which are purposefully packed with corporate \u201cscientists.\u201d\n\nThis comparison isn\u2019t worthy of a serious debate \u201chomemade fries or cookies probably aren\u2019t all that much healthier than the ultraprocessed, store-bought versions.\u201d",
        "People making decent money don\u2019t even know soda taxes exist. No one cares if coke costs $7 vs $5. Unless of course you\u2019re poor.",
        "I\u2019m sure most people are not putting hummus and yogurt into that category. \nWho\u2019s paying off this guy. And have you looked at the list of ingredients I. Any box or can in Your home.  Even plain cereals have \u201cstuff\u201d in them. \nPersonally, I think the problem is more than that. \n For years we\u2019ve been fed inaccuracies about food groups.  Don\u2019t eat this, don\u2019t eat that, cut all of this out or eat tons of something. \nIt\u2019s ridiculous! \nWhat needs to be done is research! And not by people funded by the food industry. \nEggs, dairy, fat, bread etc are not enemies. The enemies are the poisoned soil we grow our crops in and the feed for our animals. We don\u2019t need to feed the world with poorly cultivated crops. We need to grow good, healthy crops and feed animals. \nAnd stop the scare! Really! Something is causing these high rates of diabetes, but no one has the answer yet!",
        "Well, somebody who makes a living as a \"food consutant\" - whatever that means excactly- for  a company like  Beyond Meat, has to defend somehow processed foods, as there is no other way to mix up pre-made dishes. If these superficial conconctions are any healthier than eating fresh, local ingredients, is doubtful, even if it is supposed to be \"good for the planet.\" Somehow they all have to have the same additives to increase shelf life, period.",
        "There is something very amiss in the food supply here in the U.S. I've been struggling, trying to eat healthier foods and exercising four days a week. How is it that I spent a week in France, eating well 3 times a day, and when I returned home , my weight was down about 3 pounds?",
        "All talk about ultra processed foods is nonsensical when it remains so poorly defined. \n\nA lot of the latest research is showing that the problems with ultra processed food may simply boil down to sugary foods and processed meats. \n\nMost of the other \u201cultra processed\u201d foods are just fine. \n\nUnfortunately ultra processed is too poorly defined a term to be of any use whatsoever.",
        "The whole rise in American body weight in the late 70s and its continued rise, all at once, regardless of age or gender or occupation, is just wild to me. The NIH website points to soda and UPFs as the likeliest culprits but the timing and widespread nature of it to me is just so weird. Like we had chips and soda and velveeta before 1976. Was it an additive? Was it price? It feels like this should be a very obvious answer because it\u2019s such a short window of time. Article make a good point that not all UPFs are bad. What is it, though, that made the world fatter than it\u2019s ever been?",
        "The reality is that most foods lumped into the \"ultra processed category\" really are intrinsically unhealthy and should be consumed on a minimal basis, instead of multiple times daily. Many of these foods are the worst culprits in the American diet -- think most of the foods that come in plastic wrappers, boxes, and nearly all of the calorie-containing drinks that come in plastic, glass and tin bottles and cans. \n\nCertainly, there are also some food staples in this broad category, like bread, that deserve to be spared this ugly label. \n\nBut, the fact that there is nuance to this issue should not stop experts from weighing in -- we need to dramatically cut back on the production of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods if we are to have any chance at over-coming the obesity epidemic.",
        "Articles like this remind me of the frog in boiling water.  It is insane to suggest industrial agriculture is the only way to grow food, and ultra-processed food has upside when you look at the health outcomes of modern Americans.  More people die each year from chronic disease than all casualties of war in our nation's history.  Upwards of 20% of children under 18 years old have fatty liver disease - previously found almost exclusively in late stage alcoholics.  But hey, slow down, what are taxi drivers going to eat at 2am?!  \n\nPeasants baked sourdough bread for their families for thousands of years, but now it is some bougie trend?  Give me a break.     \n\nThe expert scientists advising on the federal dietary guidelines. (and the NYT Editorial board) cannot see the forest for the trees.  \n\nIndustrial Ag, Big Food, Pharma and Healthcare = Trillions of dollars.  It is about exploiting natural resources to profit, creating addictive food to profit, and selling pills to profit.  It's about money.  That's it.  If we are so addicted to this model that it is quite literally killing us, perhaps it is time to get sober.",
        "Regardless of the specifics, bringing about a transition to healthier foods will require education.  That means taking time to educate students, probably in high school.  Imagine the howls when the parent's rights crowd confronts the idea that their children might learn to eat different foods.",
        "I would love to know why we are still fortifying breads and cereals\u2026it\u2019s not 1930, and we get more than enough food these days to satisfy our daily vitamin requirements.",
        "Lately I've been thinking about the way my dog eats.  He's a mutt, a lean, athletic German Shepherd mix.  No fat or flab on him.  He eats twice a day, an ultraprocessed kibble mixed 50/50 with a \"fresh\" frozen dog food.  Same meal, same portion, twice a day, every day.  The only variation is some good boy treats.  He doesn't binge, he doesn't eat for entertainment, he doesn't overeat.  I mean, he would if he could, but he can't, so he doesn't.  He looks fabulous!  He feels great!  His vet is effusive with praise!  \n\nIf I ate with the same discipline, might I expect the same results?  Even if half my meal was 50% ultraprocessed, if I ate the same thing in the same amount 2x per day, meeting all my nutritional requirements, punctuated only by the occasional good boy treat, what then?",
        "This is just a question.  What is the definition of a processed vs unprocessed food?  How do we define it?\n\nFor example, Is tofu a processed food? You can find tofu in a bunch of health minded cookbooks, but it seems far away in some respects from its original form. \n\nWhat are the criteria used to say something is processed vs unprocessed?  I am just fundamentally curious.",
        "The challenge of our decade is how to make \"grab and go\" convenience food basically healthy.",
        "Next will be an article claiming processed food is actually healthier than healthy food.  The corporate food industry must really fear RFK.",
        "There is a splash of false equivalency in this article.  Yes, just because a food has undergone processing, does not necessarily make it bad or unhealthy.  Take hummus which the writer mentions.  It is processed with cooked garbanzo  beans, tahini and lemon juice.  Not much to object to here.  But read the labels on true ultra-processed non-foods with their bewildering list of non-identifiable ingredients, and then tell me one should put them into their mouths.  I can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I am pretty sure of what is appropriate to eat and what is not,",
        "Unless one eats like a monk, it would be pretty difficult for most to follow some of the advice given below. It's still good advice that I have for the most part followed since leaving university. As I age, it's taking more and more will power to do so, maybe because I watch more football these days and am exposed to all the fast-food ads. Fortunately (maybe) I no longer seem to have much of a taste for such foods.",
        "Some breakfast cereals are fine, even healthy - Cheerios, bran flakes. Others are absolutely awful - Fruity Pebbles, Cap'n Crunch. Don't put them in the same boat.",
        "Some decades ago these ultra processed foods and artificial ingredients were not there. Were they added to our food supply after conducting extensive trials? Now that these foods have become the norm, we have to say that they are good until proven bad? What logic is that?",
        "Yes, our food system is broken. But let\u2019s talk about the subsidies!! Where would the incentive for our profit driven economy be? The meat and dairy industry would a great place to start, but I don\u2019t see Kennedy and Trump changing this? The government needs to drive the change from mono crops and factory farms to a more healthy system. What\u2019s Kennedy\u2019s actual plan?",
        "Seems like there is a lot of cultural stigma attached to kids who eat healthy food from home vs. junk food at school. Then that is internalized into adulthood and then you're 30, 40, 50, 60 going through the drive through multiple times a week. Then you get diabetes or heart disease and you know why but eating junk food is part of your identity so you probably won't stop.",
        "Mostly unsupported \"feelings\" without references or citation. The data seem pop-sci rather than research based. Not helpful nor persuasive.",
        "Why does it have to be so hard? A trip to the market used to be enjoyable. Now I bring readers and use my phone as a dictionary. They say eat more vegetables, but vegetables are potentially covered in listeria and e-coli. Same with lean proteins, but fish and chicken are factory farmed resulting in exposure to antibiotics and germs galore. It\u2019s completely absurd to ask us all to grow and raise our own food. It\u2019s equally impossible to buy vegetables and meat from single source, organic and clean farms stands. I\u2019m exhausted by it all.",
        "The taxi driver can bring a peanut butter sandwich made with a low sugar peanut butter. The mother can use a rice cooker to cook many meals of rice to last days. Frozen veggies, tofu and tempeh require almost no preparation though they are all somewhat processed. Plain canned beans in BPA free cans require only heating. All those options are faster, cheaper and healthier than ordering in or stopping by a fast food place. Or cook a large quantity on the weekend and freeze meals. It is sometimes a matter of education about how to eat healthy and learning healthy economical habits.",
        "Michele Obama tried to make a difference and was shut down. Jamie Oliver had a great program going to schools and trying to teach them how to make better food cheaper for the kids. Where did that go? Trump appointed a vaccine naysayer and science skeptic as his mouthpiece regarding food, additives and vaccines. Yes he (Kennedy) is correct in saying we have an issue but without both science , support, and yes - MONEY, public schools - and the general public - will never be able to eat what they should. But hey a billionaire might lose a few billion and still be richer then 99.9% of the world so lets address that instead. The old saw - eat like your grandparents - isn't a bad one to follow (or great grandparents) if you are a millennial. Cook your own food, take the time to shop and eat properly. You are maintaining the only body you will ever have so take the time and both enjoy what you do to - and with it. Its not hard, just take the time you spend on line watching cat videos or TikTok and instead, take a walk, go to the store, buy food, look up easy recipes and live longer and better.",
        "How much did General Mills and Kraft pay you to write this? I think most people know what types of ultra-processed products are problematic, and it isn't moderately processed hummus and breads with few, real ingredients. \n\nIt's fascinating to observe all the diet advocates arguing about which diet is most effective for maintaining a healthy weight. But what most of these diets (e.g., paleo, plant-based, Mediterranean, carnivore, etc.) have in common is the elimination of most, or all, processed foods (and as a result, added sugar). \n\nIf you need more evidence, spend two months eating some combination of meat/poultry/seafood, veggies, fruits, and nuts. Unless you are in the minority, any extra pounds will fall off you and you'll feel amazing. \n\nThis isn't hard.",
        "The author\u2019s opinion is a bit muddled. It\u2019s true that there\u2019s little conclusive evidence that ultra-processed foods are bad for us. Nutrition studies are notoriously difficult - there are so many variables and the time frames are often too short. That said, there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that ultra-processed foods are terribly unhealthy when consumed regularly. Not only that - they are entirely unnecessary. One rule of thumb is: avoid any food that\u2019s advertised on the Super Bowl. Nobody needs Doritos or Lunchables or Mountain Dew or McDonalds or Pepsi or Dunkins or Pringles or\u2026you get my point. These \u201cfoods\u201d are drugs - engineered to be addictive and binged. Just say no.",
        "\u201cBut studies have not found a difference in health impact between industrially processed and homemade bread.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dubious to refer to studies without a citation.",
        "This is a vivid example of how our scientific community has been distorted by their their relationship to commerce. We see it all the time in medicine where doctors have literally zero ideas about nutritional solutions to problems, but will instantly give you pills to take for the same things--pills that have serious side effects and don't work that well. Doctors are tethered to their relationship to Big Pharma, which distorts their understanding of the human body, and it's both confusing and killing us.",
        "Just remember that for most people, being healthy depends on 5 things:  eating food that is natural and nutritious, movement of body (exercise, walking, running, yoga and other forms of body movement), sleeping sufficiently and qualitatively, managing stress and having consciousness (thinking beyond yourself for the betterment of others and our earth).  These \"Five Principles\" first disclosed by Mango Dass will change your life.  Start today.  Peace and health to all.",
        "When my wife and I built our new kitchen, we opted not to have a microwave. Slowing down our cooking means that we not only make healthier meals (usually from raw ingredients instead of \"ultraprocessed\" foods), but we also enjoy that time spent together. And we most definitely aren't making French fries: tonight's dinner will be some fiber-rich yams, roasted asparagus with a hint of olive oil and fresh ground pepper, and two lean tuna steaks.\n\nI think there's something very fundamentally wrong when we're trying to justify \"ultraprocessed\" foods as this article attempts to. If life is too busy to make healthy meals, then surely there's something else that can be cut out to make more room for healthy eating.\n\nAt least, that's what this heart attack survivor has learned.",
        "It is crazy difficult to purchase high quality food in the U.S.   It's like finding a needle in a hay stack.   I have to read the back of every package and memorize the caloric content of each food I eat.   \n\nAnother way low cost way to improve food consumption is labeling.  A simple indicator which grades the health benefits of each specific food offered for sale.  Red = bad, blue = OK, green = healthy.   \n\nAnother problem is knowing how to cook.  Much fast food is consumed because Americans don't know how to cook.  Many healthy dishes are less expensive and can be made quickly.",
        "Hey, if anyone thinks ultraprocessed food is a net good, then have at it. I won't stand in your way!\n\nI'll stick to the grass-fed beef and pasture-raised chicken from my local farm, organic veggies, eggs and some morning oatmeal for carbs.",
        "They will never tell you that the whole food plant based diet is the healthiest diet in the world that decreases internal inflammation and reverses many chronic diseases. People won't listen anyway-they want to believe in their processed foods and meat.",
        "This article is laughable at best. Ultra processed foods are not good ever. And we all know what the Standard American Diet (SAD) is doing to American's health. The food pyramid should be turned upside down if you want to eat heathier. \n\nHow many times have food and drug companies been sued in the past? Too many times to count. You have Nestle that bought Garden of Life and immediately changed the product ingredients so it would be cheaper to produce. I know about this because I was involved with GOL at the time Nestle bought them. \n\nAnd how about the Winkelbauer v. Welch Foods Inc case? They like to claim their fruit snacks as containing no preservatives although the ingredient statement discloses the presence of citric and lactic acid. \n\nLet's not forget how deceptive the \"no preservatives\" or no artificial flavors\" labeling is as well.\n\nIN fact, just 27% of a recent survey of the FDA said they trusted the FDA. That's a pretty low number for an agency that is supposedly looking out for our best interest. \n\nAnd the amount of chemicals that are allowed in our foods is astounding! California is outlawing the use of brominated vegtable oil, potassium bromate, propyl paraben and red dye #3 in 2025. There are 26 other chemicals used in personal care products that CA will ban as well. \n\nThe FDA is untrustworthy and the governement officials associated with them are getting their pockets padded. \n\nIt's time we wake up and start making better decisions in this country.",
        "The biggest ills have been known for half a century\u2026\n\nIndeed they have. And yet here we are. Because of lobbyists. Every problem America is facing comes down to our large and unrestrained lobby culture: Healthcare, guns, water safety, food safety, the amount of sugar or corn in our food, you name it. Every beneficial law that Congress would like to pass gets watered down or killed altogether because no one can deny the temptations proffered by a good lobbyist.\n\nThis is the real reason Americans are so much more unhealthy than our peer countries.",
        "\"Pack my kid's lunch\" videos on social media provide a fascinating glimpse into various approaches to one of the most common stressors of many parents and show a strong dependency on ultraprocessed foods. \n\nI saw one video yesterday in which a mom created homemade \"happy meals\" for her kids when they asked for McD's. She cooked homemade buns, hamburgers, and fries (which all looked both delicious and doable to me.) Most of the comments were, \"just take the kids to mcd's\" or \"it probably cost ten times as much to make that at home than go through the drive-thru.\" \n\nAs for packing kids' lunch: The beautiful organic lunches with the fruit cut into animal shapes are ridiculed for being unrealistic and expensive. The conventional lunches with snack-size chips and a sack of fruit snacks are defended for being the only thing a normal family can muster on any given day.\n\nThere is a middle ground! An insulated lunch box and a cold pack will get you a long way. Fill it with a cup of fresh fruit, a slice or two of protein (leftovers from supper will do), and a few whole wheat crackers. \n\nSome of the \"food\" sold in stores should be labeled as \"stuff you can put in your mouth but don't expect it to nourish you\"... such as just about everything in the \"snack\" aisle, all the cute yogurts stuffed with gummies, chocolate chips, and fruity cereals, and the beloved lunchables. \n\nIt is possible to eat well without breaking the bank. Bring back HOME EC to teach us how.",
        "I would like to raise a point independent of the contents of this opinion piece: I don\u2019t think it is ethical to leverage the weight of an Oxford affiliation to advocate for more or less moderation  in our approach to UPFs, or to comment on their healthiness, or lack thereof, when there is a direct conflict of interest by consulting for companies that commercially benefit from the production of UPFs (regardless of whether they provide climate-friendly alternatives, that is another discussion).\n\nWe are not particularly happy to receive health advice by researchers who consult for, or receive payment from, tobacco companies.  Why are interactions between UPF-producing companies and health/wellbeing research any different?",
        "Excellent article. The economic factor cannot be underestimated. Healthier food should be LESS EXPENSIVE than unhealthy food.",
        "So the FDA has found evidence regarding ultraprocessed foods inconclusive. Is this the same FDA that still includes bread and cereals as the foundation of the food pyramid?\n\nAnother reason to avoid processing is plastics, which have increasingly entered our bloodstreams, with a high correlation to amount of processed food eaten and strong evidence for harm to health. \n\nIt may be true that not all UPF are equally bad. But it may be more clear to advise that eating less processed, lower sugar, lower saturated fat foods and more fruits and vegetables and nuts is a good rule of thumb for healthful eating.",
        "Re this disclaimer \u2018Full disclosure: I have consulted for food companies that I feel make beneficial products, including Beyond Meat, which makes ultraprocessed meat alternatives that I believe are better for the planet.\u2019  Fine \u2014 but are they  good for human health? That\u2019s the focus of this article, not climate impact.

        "The author\u2019s premise is correct but the proposed solution is wrongheaded. Americans don\u2019t like taxes, and the suggested tax is too easily opposed on the grounds that the \u201cnanny state\u201d wants to take away things that Americans love. \n\nThe correct solution is to take a hint from the auto industry and impose stringent regulations coupled with fines that only apply if the regulations are broken, while giving small producers exemptions or allowing them to use simplified regulations. This should be coupled with a long term shift in agricultural policy to end subsidies that encourage production of high fructose corn syrup.",
        "It\u2019s the QUANTITY of the food we eat as much (or more) than the quality. Plenty of overweight people eschew all processed foods and eat home cooked meals. The problem is portion size, snacking in between meals, and our broken hunger cues. I suffer from constant food noise and an insatiable appetite. The only way for me to shut up my gut without becoming enormous is to gorge on massive quantities vegetables and lean protein. Ultra processed foods make us fat because they don\u2019t make us feel full, so we are constantly chasing satiety by consumer more calories than our bodies need.",
        "Everyone should read:  Michael Moss's \"Salt Sugar Fat\" and Michael Pollen's \"In Defense of Food\". Michael Moss' book should make everyone angry when they read about how food companies intentionally tweak sugar content to hit a literal sweet spot to make them more addictive.",
        "The linked article which the author claims to explain that some ultra processed foods are better than others concludes: \u201cyou can\u2019t go wrong with consuming mostly unprocessed or minimally processed foods.\u201d The author\u2019s explanation for why we shouldn\u2019t follow this guidance? It\u2019s not realistic for cab drivers and single mothers. Forgive me for wanting to know what the healthiest food options are for the British royal family! Then let\u2019s make that realistic for cab drivers. (And what is more realistic for a 1 am snack: a Beyond burger, or two handfuls of peanuts, a banana, and an apple?)",
        "This sounds like panic because RFK Jr. is coming on board and might actually do something good.  Good, if he can get our food up to the standards of Canada and Europe - that\u2019s probably even worth a Trump presidency.  It is a big deal.  Honestly, anyone who travels knows the difference in food quality  (and prices) are glaring.  Already, these big companies are scrambling to remove these ingredients proactively - this should be applauded.",
        "This seems to be more of an issue of labeling than anything else. Store bought whole grain bread shouldn't be lumped in with chocolate chip cookies, and this is so obvious that it shouldn't need to be stated, yet the \"processed\" label is stuck equally to both. We used to call the latter item \"junk\" food, and it seems to make sense to go back to that. It's a label that people can understand instantly and is more about the nutritional content than the method of production. \n\nOf course the other major reason that energy dense junk food is cheap is because of the misguided federal government policy to subsidize grains such as wheat and corn, the two key ingredients in so much of what goes into these products.",
        "What I think what we should focus on a simple message is cutting out sugar.  Debating what is a processed food vs unprocessed food gets murky.  Is a yogurt that comes in a processed food container a bad food?  I can tell you having gestational diabetes, plain Greek yogurt did not spike my blood sugar, but all the fruit flavoured sugary yogurt did.\n\nI think if we focused a a simple message of removing added sugars we would do a lot of good.  And it would be pretty simple.  You can measure it in grams.\n\nSugar has been linked to so many bad health conditions that I think focusing their to start makes a lot of sense and is more clear cut.",

And modern society is so bonkers that just banning all UP foods in never going to happen. \n\nUnfortunately, this article is too puffy (ultra processed perhaps? Chuckle chuckle) for any helpful discussion. Tax foods more? Great, how does that address the lack of produce in many areas, the issues with produce practice, etc etc. When done well, the issue with ultra processed food is getting at something deeper \u2014 how our food is made \u2014 and without addressing that and merely relying on current, not robust, data \u2014 just becomes one more puff in the air of discussion.

The food industry is squeeling like a stuck pig because they can cheapen up the food we consume with chemicals and additives for more profit. If this author is part of the panel that gives guidelines for our school lunch programs, he has nothing to crow about. American meals in schools are some of the most unhealthy in the world.

I believe the author missed the mark to address the larger systemic changed which needs to occur for the American diet to significantly change. While acknowledging that it is difficult for some people to find or have the time to consume unprocessed foods, an agreement to change the system is not taxes. Taxing the acceptable food available for working class families is a poverty tax. Rather than raising the taxes on working class families, the argument to your elected officials should be to stop subsidies on industries like the corn industry, an ingredient widely used in many of these high energy density, low fiber foods. Instead advocate that your elected officials promote and provide incentives to farmers who are growing fruits, vegetables, and legumes that this author argues we should be all eating more of. Providing subsidies to these farmers for domestic production of these crops promotes more of these foods to be used in an acceptable way. Taxing a soda is a bandaid on the corporate industrial farming complex. This could have been an opportunity to talk about the need to tell you elected officials to take up this work on the neglected farm bill, instead this author chose to ignore how systemic change happens and instead peddled a soda tax narrative that\u2019s been proven ineffective.",

Is it because of the messenger (RFK Jr.)?  Or is it because of the partnership with Beyond Meat?  Yes, a strong inference, but a fair one I would say.",

It takes some planning, carving out some time, but if done on a regular basis, it becomes easy to manage. If you clean up your diet and avoid most processed foods, the thought later of returning  those items to your diet becomes very undesirable.  As a working mom, I packed my kids lunches and made dinner every day.  There are times I hated it of course, but as time went on, I got better at it and have a collection of fast, easy, nutritious meals.  If you want to make this a priority, you do.",

Just common sense.",

I could make you a tuna salad with a side of vegetables for less. As for homemade bread it is much cheaper to make than the $5 dollars and up that stores want and most bread doesn't require butter. I have friends who both work but still have time to make bread with their children. Most people who are needy do receive some assistance from the state. They can budget it on processed foods or salads, fresh and frozen vegetables and a choice of protein or stick with processed foods that are toxic and often no cheaper, certainly not for the body.",

Who funded them? Were they peer reviewed and published in respectable journals? What were the controls? How were the study subjects chosen? I know it's hard to get at this in this kind of article, and I know it's hard to conduct rigorous studies on something as complicated as diet without involving a host of other variables. That's why we keep debating the health benefits or risks associated with dietary factors, and why scientific advice keeps changing all the time.

        "The balance between needing to eat healthy foods and being pressed for time, has long been an issue in our country.  I would be hard pressed to believe that pursuing and retaining  the ultraprocessed foods markets is the answer to that.  In fact, quite the opposite.  Keep doing more of the same, keep getting the same results.  This is foot dragging at best.  Especially as more and more doctors are trying to encourage patients to change their diets in order to get results that modern medicine can't provide.\n\nThese ultraprocessed foods, by designed, packed with high sugars (to improve flavor) and sodium (to prolong shelf life).  And in terms of the effects of these types of foods on your body, the amount of research regarding it is extensive and far too much to quote in a comment. Truly, you only need to consult with your primary care doctor on what the effects of this type of diet will wrought on your body.   From high blood pressure to diabetes. \n\nThere are some business ventures (it is the American way) that are trying to meet this need by offering delivered healthily pre-prepared meals, but often times their price points are comparatively still too high versus buying boxed meals and microwaving them.  Perhaps we should find a way to invest/subsidize these companies and their approach to creating a more healthy yet still convenient option?",
