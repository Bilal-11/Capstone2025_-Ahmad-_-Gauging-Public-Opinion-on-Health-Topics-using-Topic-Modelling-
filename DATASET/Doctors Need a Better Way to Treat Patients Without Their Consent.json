        "For me is better the court order instead of letting the medics do anything they want with their patients.",

        "To all the medical tyrants: WE WILL NOT COMPLY!",
        "My questions start with Dr. Juahar's first paragraph. \"Not long ago, I took care of a middle-aged man at my hospital who had severe heart failure requiring life support. When he was disconnected from machines after a few days of treatment, he began to display psychotic symptoms, including delusional thinking, tangential speech and paranoia.\"  Should we assume the man was sedated and/or restrained while receiving life support?  Restraint traumatizes the restrained.  Being restrained while drugged can cause delusional thinking in the absence of prior diagnosed mental illness.  \n\nPhysicians and medical ethicists considering utility, use medical and financial resources and legal liability have a vested interested in forcing compliance with treatment on patients who are ill. \n\nI am glad that Dr. Juahar's patient didn't have to go to court.  I am glad Dr. Juahar's patient was not restrained or subjected to ECT.  I once attended a local League of Women Voters presentation on end-of-life issues.  It was chilling to hear one local representative speak approvingly of how, in the 1960's and 1970's, \"mild\" ECT was given to elderly cancer patients who didn't want treatment. \n\nWhenever anyone wants to force someone into treatment or into confinement for their own good, it is very important to consider who else might be benefitting.",
        "This is odd.\nIt was my experience with a loved one that hospitals were eager to discharge, if not directly home, to rehab. And rehabs were also eager to discharge, unless they also had a skilled nursing component with available beds for Medicaid patients. \n\nMy loved one was exhibiting cognitive decline, vision problems and hallucinations. For nine months I begged doctors at three facilities to help me get his driver\u2019s license revoked. I got no help. He was shuffled along and out. Once released and behind the wheel, he had three hit-and-run accidents within a span of 4 months, each time eluding the police. \nEach incident resulting in injury that led to an ER visit, brief hospital stay and then rehab & discharge with PT/OT & Visiting nurse. \nFirst agency nurse determined he shouldn\u2019t have been released to live alone. So upon his second release, their agency refused another referral for him. A new agency was found. Their visiting nurse had the same opinion. She\u2019d report this as elder abuse, and alerted his primary care doc who advised \u201cTake him back to ER and leave him there. Accept no release or transfer unless to dementia facility.\u201d \n\nI did have to engage law enforcement directly to get his license removed from his possession. Fortunately, they were able to do this without an arrest. He died shortly after, furious with me for calling the authorities.",
        "I would agree with this opinion if our medical system was not based on a profit sharing system. The longer the patient stays in the hospital, the more drugs they are prescribed, and tests are run the more the more medical system makes. I am not saying everyone thinks this way but I have seen it for myself. My mother had dementia and was basically brain dead the last few years of her like. She kept getting a uninary track infection and was rushed to the hospital 6 times over two years for emergency treatment. After the last time we said no more. She died peacefully a few weeks later. I believe they were keeping her alive for the money. Everyone needs an advanced directive on what treatment end of life treatment they want and find someone to represent you when you cannot make decisions for yourself.",
        "We, the patients, regardless of whether the condition is mental or physical, should never, never, ever lose the right to refuse treatment, even if it means we're going to die. What are we going to do now, start forcing people to stop eating at McDougal's, and eat vegetables? Americans regularly, glaringly violate their own bodies. We're slowly killing ourselves. Are you going to save us all from ourselves? No? Then, who are you to save anyone, just because you think they're \"mentally incompetent\", from themself? Who will save all of us from the greed-driven Medical & Mental Illness Industrial Complex? Keep yer mitts off our bodies, and minds...unless, of course, we break the law. Then resort to the courts. Enough.",
        "I'l an old doctor. The author is young.  You're only a doctor, you're not God.  You do the best you can for the patient and understand the laws are written to protect people.  Especially to protect them from overzealous physicians. We used to have warehouses for schizophrenics.  They were called State Mental Hospitals.  They weren't very pretty places.",
        "The idea that a judge cannot make a reasonable decision about the ethical course of action for a patient because they are not medically trained is hogwash. This is not about making a medical diagnosis; it is about patient rights, overseen and determined by an impartial professional who has no profit motive or other axe to grind.  The author's argument, to my mind, is yet another example of physician arrogance and grandiosity.  The policy he recommends would only add to the all-too-common perception that the physician is \"in charge\" and the patient or family must comply with \"doctor's orders\". That would be an enormous step backward at a time when patient awareness and empowerment are  fledgling concepts that are just beginning to offer some dignity for us all as consumers of medical care. Doctors are experts in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Their professional knowledge ends there. They are not experts in law, ethics or morality. And despite the intimidation so many people feel in their presence, they not gods and they are not omniscient. The court of law exists for a reason. Let it do its job.",
        "The man died in peace.  It was his choice.",
        "My initial response to the title of this article was complete disagreement\u2014why is the writer seeking to do something without consent? But when he explained the judicial process...there are a number of judges throughout the country who would be shocked to learn they are not, in fact, doctors! Head down to Amarillo, TX and you'll find one who believes he understands medicine better than doctors and the FDA! \n\nWe should strive to never provide or withhold treatment without consent but if that is not possible, the kind of independent panel of experts the writer describes seems reasonable, if imperfect.",
        "I hope this entire article is only about those patients without any relatives to act on their behalf. Otherwise the article does not make sense",
        "Another way to ask this question:\n\"Does a physician have a responsibility to prevent a competent patient from committing suicide?\" According to many the answer is no. Somebody please tell the lawyers. Doctors, please step aside.",
        "As you say, forced treatment of patients can easily be abused.  And for guess who?  Women and minorities.\n\nAs to untrained judges, very simple solution:  Train them.",
        "The author clearly shows good intentions.  But not all committees will have similar motivation.  And we know which road is paved with good intentions.",
        "Some fixes are easy -- as I know from years of working in a Trauma ICU. A patient admitted for an injury sustained while inebriated is essentially not allowed to sign out Against Medical Advice (AMA) until their blood alcohol level is back within normal limits. There is essentially no question that they are too impaired to make a rational judgment while drunk.\n\nBut psychiatric illness is a whole other area that presents almost insurmountable barriers. There are never enough treatment options on the outside -- halfway houses, day treatment centers, addiction recovery treatment centers, etc. Often the only choice is to hold someone deemed a danger to themselves or others for several days until they are stabilized and then release them to ... sometimes home, sometimes back onto the street  where they were living prior. \n\nWithout adequate follow up and treatment, many people decide they are \"better\" and don't need their medication any longer, ending up back in the ED in another crisis. \n\nIt is an incredibly frustrating cycle, unsafe for both the patients in crisis and sometimes for those they come in contact with on the street.",
        "Patients should get what they want even if  that decision results in self harm or death. Physicians can object and even sign off a patient's case if they strongly disagree but only if they can find another physician willing to assume care/responsibility. This won't be as big a problem soon as an entire generation of physicians retires and society is left with the shift worker physicians, nurse practitioners and PAs taking their place. If autonomy is what patient's want, then that is what they will get because that is all they will have.",
        "The author needs some in-depth teaching about recognizing and managing conflicts of interest.  Simply asking foxes from out of town to decide whether the local fox can eat the chickens isn't a \"safeguard\" - it's a way to pretend you are protecting the chickens while getting the answer you want.  Things may have improved from the 1970's but we still see doctors and hospitals making decisions for reasons of profits not patient well-being, trainees who want to practice what they are learning even if it means flogging the patient for no benefit, and too many doctors and hospitals allowing things like medical sexual assault under the excuse of \"trainees have to learn pelvic exams somehow!\".",
        "Nurse here: absolutely not. And the idea that social work or nursing will weigh in and the MD will relent is not realistic. Too, I have not seen a lot of \"shared decision making\" in the inpatient setting. As others have noted, there is too much room for non-transparent, unilateral abuse...",
        "Doctors generally believe in providing medical intervention.  Patients don't always believe in medical intervention.  That to me means that doctors shouldn't be the ultimate arbiters, even a panel of uninvolved doctors.  They are mostly trained to believe the same things about medicine.\n\nI would prefer to see a system where two points of view on the situation are presented to a panel of 3 neutral people.  The people presenting to the panel should not be the treating physicians to increase neutraility.",
        "I don't quite agree with the author, though it is clear he comes from a place of good intentions and concern for patients.\n\nThe law is there to protect the patients and that is distinct from providing appropriate medical care. Consent decisions cannot be left to medical team only. Just imagine how organ donation could go. This is a legal issue and goes to the rights + protections of the citizen.",
        "The fault in the author\u2019s argument is that the decision to treat over objection is not a medical one but instead a legal matter, the patient\u2019s right to freedom.",
        "As a retired physician, I can sympathize with the author\u2019s perspective.  \n\nBut that perspective does not serve the patient and is dangerous. \nLeaving healthcare decision making without public external oversight has and will lead to unconscionable abuse. \n\nThe request for immunity says it all.\n\nIf you want to see how it works, just look at the secrecy cloaking medical errors, patient safety and peer review.  Oh, that\u2019s right, you can\u2019t.  And 400,000 die in the US from preventable medical errors. \n\nThe health care industry must have public accountability and oversight.",
        "There is a \"PROFIT MOTIVE\" involved here, but not in the way most commenters seem to think. \n\nThe inpatient stay for this poor guy with \"a long history of untreated schizophrenia\" is going to be a massive financial hit for the hospital, as he is likely uninsured. The administration would love it if he discharged himself.  The docs who are trying to keep him admitted are actually fighting against the hospital's financial interests.",
        "While there may be times that people should be treated against their poorly informed and incapable wishes --- there are also times where treatment only stabilizes them to the point that they allow themselves to decompensate cyclically over and over and over again. Our health system can no longer support such things. If someone reaches the point where they are no longer gravely disabled and choose to refuse care - well, that may be their right - BUT if that is the path they choose repetitively then they should be transported FAR AWAY from the eyes of the good samaritans who have no interest in paying the expenses but are happy to call 911 to endlessly return such people to the system for yet another \"tune up\", rinse, wash, repeat. The good samaritans aren't happy when they can't get timely care, but they will be happy to endlessly gum up the system with the serial problem patient who have proved by their fourth or tenth encounter with the system that their care is ultimately pointless and inflicts both expense AND HARM upon other patients (not receiving those resources) and the people working in our failing health systems who are subjected to serial moral injury trying to fix the unfixable so that other members of society can feel better about themselves.",
        "The legal right to not consent to treatment is the only leverage patients have to force arrogant or overly self-assured medical personnel to accept a collaborative approach to choosing a course of treatment. Without the right to not consent, kidney dialysis patients, for example, would be fighting terrible cramps because the dialysis centers' staff invariably set overly aggressive fluid removal goals (it's the culture of the DCs).",
        "A compelling case for treating patients without consent is when a placebo looks like a good choice.  Of course, you can't ask a patient to take a placebo.  But if you could. . .\n\nMaybe there should be a universal consent form, like for organ donors?\n\nThink of all the prescription drugs not needed, the risks and costs avoided.",
        "I sat on a civil medical malpractice case recently as a juror. Briefly here is what happened. \n\nMan presented himself to the emergency room thinking he might be having a stroke \n\nNeurologist confirms he is. Recommends taking a certain medication to stop the stroke.  The medication\u2019s effectiveness goes down as time passes. Medication is not effective after 4&1/2 hours from onset of stroke. However patient must specifically give consent to this particular medication for it to be administered. Patient does not give consent within 4&1/2 hour window therefore medication is not administered and he suffers a full blown stroke. \n\nPatient sues the hospital for not administering the medication thinking he presented himself in a timely manner however hospital argues that he did not give consent. The law requires consent for this medication otherwise the hospital could be held for criminal assault if administered otherwise. Because of the law, we had to find for the hospital. He didn\u2019t give consent. \n\nNow here is the rub\u2026 When someone is experiencing a stroke, their brain is literally dying. That \u2018s what a stroke is. Your brain tissue is dying. How can this person be able to give consent when their brain is dying? But that is what the law says and the hospital and doctors had to abide by the law. If he was comatose, they could have administered. But because he was awake and aware, they could not. Nor could they reach out to next of kin. This is not sensible.",
        "Times have changed but humans are still humans.    They defer to others too frequently when they have something at stake, even imagined social standing.    Committees are known to be easily dominated by strong personality.     Even if the members had nothing to do with the care of a particular patient, they likely have had much to do with other members of the committee, making them nowhere near unbiased.     I still see benefit in an external third party (ie, a judge).    Just like democracy, it's the worst idea out there, except for the alternatives.",
        "Judges are required to make decisions beyond their technical expertise all the time, not just with respect to medical issues. Requiring hospitals and doctors who seek to medicate patients over their objection to justify their decision to a judge provides a discipline that an in-house panel of their colleagues could not provide. If courts approve 95% of such requests it is, one hopes, because the prospect of that reviews leads petitioning clinicians to be very careful in deciding whether the requested involuntary treatment is truly in the patient's best interests.",
        "I have been interacting with someone with a mild case for forty years. The inability to treat the disease, that from the patient's point of view, does not exist. This creates suffering for the patient. They cannot and never will see it. They will eventually die of old age regularly declaring \"I'm not mentally ill.\" As Shakespeare said in Hamlet \"The lady doth protest too much, methinks\"",
        "The impact of formularies are an often overlooked problem within the giant morass this piece touches upon.",
        "We used to let these people die on their own.  Considering what happens now, maybe that is preferable.",
        "As a lawyer, I am in front of judges on a regular basis. A non-medically trained individual is perfectly capable of determining if the weight of the medical evidence is truly in the patient\u2019s best interest.  The abuses of the past are now in the past not because of the medical professionals, but because of the legal system holding providers to account.  An outside, neutral arbitrator who considers the arguments advocated between opponents in an adversarial proceeding is a necessary check on the groupthink that can permeate any profession, whether it be building airplanes or practicing medicine.",
        "This guy can't actually think it's a good idea for hospital employees to be able to imprison their patients with legal immunity, right? Yikes! Judicial oversight should ALWAYS be required when you are depriving someone of their basic human rights...",
        "Put ourselves in the hands of arrogant doctors employed by  for-profit companies, what could go wrong?",
        "The author does not want the judge to make the decision because he is mot qualified in medicine. Well, I do not want the doctors making the decision because they are not qualified in law.",
        "For psychiatric patients maybe. Not for the rest of us. I was getting some blood drawn earlier and saw a number of what I call the walking wounded. I have no interest in that. Quality life not quantity. My views on life and death are contrary to those held by most in this society. I have no religious beliefs aside from some general thoughts and no moral issues about self termination. Or not pursuing care that might buy me a few more hellish years as I have seen with some. Also, the US medical system is adversarial by its nature as a for profit system. PE owners and shareholders and executives care about money and many are sociopaths or close. I manage every medical encounter these days the way I do business ones. Factual, emotionless and I document everything and correct every error in documentation. Anything that can be used against you will when it comes to money.",
        "This is one of the all time most naive, and paternalistic, proposals I've ever seen.  Many doctors ARE quite smart, but many of them are not as smart as they think they are.   Suggesting that doctors get to decide what is best for their patients who for whatever reason are lacking capacity, and that they should be immune from liability, is a terrible, terrible idea. No thanks!",
        "How about people who don't want \"life-saving\" treatment. Will they be saved for a life in bed because someone else thinks that's a good way to live? Bedsores? Love 'em!",
        "You did your best. If he insisted on going home, you should let him.",
        "For those who worry about the decision being tainted by the profit motive, here's a solution:  If a patient is treated despite his or her objections, neither the hospital nor physicians may bill for that treatment.",
        "Dr. Jauhar, you are quite wrong.  The patient has agency, but the law protects that patient in the event that something causes them to lose that agency.  Although the HIPAA Privacy Rules protect the patient's healthcare status from being disclosed without their permission, if the patient is not able to consent then the courts step in.  Only the courts can protect the patient's rights under the law.  I have faith that our judges in cases such as this will listen to what you have to say, and act in the patient's best interest.",
        "This reminds me of my father, who lived in another state. He was 80 and had just had his third heart attack. It was a mild one this time (the first two had been 21 years prior and necessitated a triple bypass). He was admitted to the hospital and they did a test that determined he had two blocked arteries and the third, the widow maker, was 30% blocked. But because of his age, they didn't immediately perform any procedures. The next morning, they brought him breakfast, eggs and bacon. He got so irate that they would bring this to a heart patient that he removed his IV, got dressed, and left the hospital. No one stopped him -- I don't know if they could have. He had some cognitive decline at that point but was clear headed enough to say that he didn't want any major procedures. Ironically he didn't end up dying of a heart attack but pneumonia five years later.",
        "First, depriving any adult of control over their own life is a matter of law, and as such should be within the purview of the courts, with all the protections afforded persons in that system.\n\nFurther, if such panels were in existence, requiring them to publish their reasons would be a clear-cut violation of patient privacy.",
        "It's hardly shocking a doctor believes doctors should have more control and less oversight over their decisions, and I am sure Dr. Jauhar believes it in earnest. \n\nIt's also exactly why judicial oversight is important. \n\nRarely is it a good idea to cede complete, unchecked authority over a person's freedom and autonomy to anyone, let alone someone who insists they should have it.",
        "\"Times have changed. We don't do those sorts of things today.\"\nThis is the justification used through history for the imposition of various measures on those who'd rather not be subject to them.\n\nThere's a wonderful speech by the director of the institution for the insane in the Peter Weiss play, briefly known as \"Marat/Sade\" which takes place not longer after the French Revolution (late 18th C.). In the play the director voices exactly the sentiments of the writer of this column. \"Times have changed,\" etc. \n\nDoes the writer believe human nature has changed? We've developed past exploiting our positions of power? Look around. Is that the case?",
        "A nation should not ever be considered to be free if people who are unpopular due to them holding in unpopular religious or political beliefs are threatened or forced to undergo punitive Psychiatric treatment by their government.",
        "Sorry, the thought of an all-medical perspective on questions of basic civil liberty and Constitutional rights does not strike me as desirable.  The biases of the medical community, and historically documented of group think overriding truth, are too well known.",
        "Doctor here who faces these situation on a daily basis.\n\nThis article is extraordinarily misleading and just plain wrong.,  Doctors do not delay the decision to incapacitate (or not) based on a legal review by the courts.  The decisions have to be made in real time.  If they were not, the patients would be essentially be held or treated against their will, and can sue for wrongful imprisonment, assault and battery etc.  \n\nDoctors have the right to declare someone incapacitated without real team court review (usually requires 2 doctors to actually examine the patient)--if they believe the patient is actively suicidal, homicidal due to delirium or psychiatric condition, or cannot safely navigate the world, which includes not understanding the consequences of decisions.  That said, patients have the right to make \"bad\" decisions if they have capacity.\n\nThe courts usually get involved in psychiatric capacity issues (but not at the time an initial decision is made).  Courts also get involved when the patient or an advocate contests the physicians' judgement.\n\nIt's hard to believe that the physician here felt like they needed to bring in a psychiatrist as part of the decision--this is rarely done.  Those of us who confronting such patients must make these decisions in the moment.  Again--failure to do so, is wrongful imprisonment if the patient wants to leave right now and you haven't amply documented why you think the patient lacks capacity.",
        "I'm a retired lawyer.  When my sister was on her death bed in the hospital I had a conversation with the attending physician about her living will.  The language in the document was fairly typical, but the doctor had a hard time understanding what her instructions were.  There's a strong tendency for doctors to want to do what they think is best regardless.  \n\nAnd then there was the problem that during her week in the busy ICU the attending physician changed three times and each new one had to have the situation explained.",
        "Judges rely on experts all the time to help them make decisions which involve fields they themselves are not expert in. A judge\u2019s lack of personal knowledge and expertise regarding a patient\u2019s condition therefore does not make the judge insufficiently qualified to make rulings on forced treatment.\n\nHaving a responsible outside party rule on these matters helps ensure that doctors and medical practices don\u2019t abuse the power the author is asking for. Since 95% of the time judges agree with doctors, a short delay in deciding a case is the downside here. That delay is worth having for what it does in protecting patients health and welfare, in my opinion.",
        "Among schizophrenics and clinically depressed patients who take their medications faithfully, a large but minority proportion do not get the relief they or their doctors intend. The proportion who end up on the street or in the criminal justice system because the refuse to take their medications are probably only a minority of those who decline to take their medications as prescribed, despite their disorders. The exceptions who present real perils to themselves or others end up representing a class in the popular discourse that concludes that compelling treatments upon individuals should be entrusted to every caregiver to resolve the problem. I think that safeguards in consideration of all the known uncertainties should apply to any kind of forced treatment upon anybody.",
        "Neither a doctor nor lawyer am I, so my take on this complex issue comes from 30,000 feet as a well-informed layperson. I have no concrete solution to this seemingly intractable problem and from the article and comments, it strikes me there are arguments on both sides that have some credence. One thing I'm sure of: with so many mentally ill individuals living on the streets with no place to call home, the current system of arresting these helpless people and keeping them in jail is NOT the answer and if allowed to continue, will only exacerbate the problem.",
        "I know someone who actually had to cancel his own medical insurance in order to escape a psychiatric institution. Their motive for profit essentially drove their testimony to the judge who authorized the incarceration. As soon as his insurance was canceled, the psychiatric need ended and he was immediately discharged.",
        "Law is a necessity for a civilized society.  However, it seems that, at least in this country, the idea of the rule of law has metastasized into that of social control by lawyers.  There is no other profession in which its practitioners believe that their opinions about things that they know nothing about outweigh those of professionals who actually do.  When we have justices haggling over the meaning of something written 100, 200+, etc. assuming it should apply to a very different society is bizarre.",
        "\"Treatment over objection\" is a tricky subject.  But judicial review has been the accepted practice over the last 40 years--and during that time homelessness has skyrocketed, with nearly 70% of those on the streets suffering from mental illness and/or addiction.  Moreover, many mass shooters also suffer from severe mental conditions.  Treatment must be a priority for the benefit of public health as well as the well-being of the individual.  The trouble always seems to start when politicians and lawyers decide that they know more about medicine than physicians.  How much longer much we all suffer under this nonsensical delusion perpetuated by our elected representatives and our judiciary?",

        "This was a costly essay to write.  I can only imagine this doctor could have saved thousands of lives in the time it took to write this scribe. /s\n\n\"In the case of my patient with heart failure, the decision ultimately didn\u2019t have to go before a judge. Multiple discussions involving the patient, the hospital ethics and palliative care teams, social workers, nurses, psychiatrists and other doctors \u2014 discussions that in many respects served the function of a formal committee of the sort I\u2019m proposing \u2014 yielded an agreement with the patient that his interests would be best served by sending him home with hospice care.\n\nCapacity must be judged relative to the decision being made, and it became clear over the course of hospitalization that our patient understood the terminal nature of his condition and had the capacity to choose hospice care. Forced treatment was unlikely to significantly improve his psychiatric symptoms before the natural progression of heart failure caused his death.\n\nSo he was discharged home. It was the best decision under the circumstances, one reached by expert deliberation, not legal procedure. He passed away a few weeks later without, fortunately, ever setting foot in court.\"\n\nSo basically, the patient was competent and exercised his agency to assert his autonomy despite this doctor's most passionate thoughts about authority. \n\nDid this doctor really think he would cure this man's mental health & body, and heal his family all in one billing code?",
        "To think that such psychiatric/medical abuses are a thing of the past is, simply put, beyond naive. If you want proof, just look at the lack of oversight of the troubled teen industry. I\u2019m sure there are plenty more examples elsewhere. While a particular situation may be heartbreaking and difficult, such as in the case of this patient, the prevention of wide-scale abuse of vulnerable patients by a medical system that often doesn\u2019t even see their own complicity, is also crucial and life saving.",
        "Last thing I would want.\n\nMy Dad had DNR paperwork with both his doctor and hospital, but when he was in the hospital, they denied us (his children) any information on his condition or care.  They ran unnecessary tests and planned unnecessary interventions that his doctor (afiliated with the hospital) had already run without ever talking to his doctor.\n\nThey told us he was capable of making his own decisions until it was completely apparent to me on the phone that he was incoherent and had no idea what they were doing to him nor why.  At that point they told us he was dying and asked for a decision that was already in the DNR.  He died about 12 hours later, while we were still making travel arrangements.\n\nEven with legal paperwork in place, they aren't  to be trusted.",
        "This is a lot of words to say you don\u2019t want to lose a day of revenue by going to court.  And that is a fact because I have worked with doctors for 35 years. \n\nDoctors frequently suffer from the notion that they are experts in all matters, when in fact many are stunted by their ice cold clinical training, the deference the world pays to them, from dinner reservations to getting out of speeding tickets.  You have no special abilities to judge a life, and the sooner you realize that, the better off your clients will be.  Clients, not patients.  Show some respect.",
        "In Canada, generally, we have the problem of keeping patients in hospital who decline treatment but are not safe to discharge.\nPhysicians often know little of the law, don't care about their obligations, and focus on their own, and hospital interests. I am generalizing, but not overstating the problem.\nAcessing courts is expensive, time consuming for staff in short supply.\n\nWe need some middle road: either court review of decisions made my physicians, or tribunals based on law, more easily accessed by  health care providers.",
        "One of my engineering instructors observed that when our computer programs work the first time, it may not be a good thing.

Overtime, I have found his advice was sound, I have seen many programs that are presented as well functioning with glitches and bugs. \n\nThe ability of people to predict outcomes with respect to subjects they know well is demonstrably only partially reliable, even if better than others with less knowledge. My experience with doctors over my lifetime is that they can be downright arrogant about listening to patients when patients present them with unexpected results, dismissing the patients as being too ignorant to have anything relevant to say. They do not have justification to distrust that their treatments are effective and they do not believe they should change what they have prescribed, so they do not trust the patients. Sometimes they are dead wrong and the patients are telling them accurate facts which are not anticipated by the standard of care.",

        "No, doctors should not make this call without independent oversite. However, a judicial panel with special training in mental illness would be a significant improvement over Judge Schmoe who has no clue. Having experienced what mock trial in high school looks like with different real local judges hearing the same fake case presented by teenagers, I can definitely say that many judges are unqualified to weigh in (or if they did, it would be to rubber stamp whatever the doctor wanted). Additionally, we need to modify current law to allow a short period of treatment over objection to keep the patient and staff safe while a decision is reached. This might be 24-72 hours for example. There are a lot of views on personal autonomy, but most of these cases are sad and can be violent, so a balance needs to be struck (and this would allow patients to more credibly express their wishes and level of understanding of the situation to the Court).",

It was necessary for us to think through our arguments about the situation and to make sure that we took into account the patient\u2019s perspective and present that to the judge.   We had to confront our own explicit and implicit biases (though I am sure we missed some) as we shared our reasons to keep the patient hospitalized.  Ultimately it was not our argument that won the day - when the patient spoke up for herself in the hearing room the judge could see her need for further treatment. \n\nLater, as a medical resident I also sat on the ethics committee of that same hospital.

Decisions are made in the form of doctor's orders and no alternatives are discussed, perhaps because there is no one available who can, or wants to, communicate well with the patient.\n\nEven in the Houston metro area, where we have a massive health care center, many people including providers do not have access to the best decision-making tools.

Why do we as a society assume, and then allow medical doctors to sit at the head of the table where decisions regarding a person\u2019s competence, autonomy, and ability for self-determination are made? Joint decision-making between patient and medical provider does not exist in visits to a health care provider: a 15-minute visit to address a concern with one\u2019s health leaves little time for anything except a cook-book response from the provider to a question from the patient. Why are we willing to assume that physician decisions on treatment of a health issue include patient preferences, family concerns, and current research regarding how best to treat a health condition?  Research has shown that this is not the case.  ALL patients should have an advocate that demands high quality, compassionate care of their whole person, especially those who suffer with complex health care issues such as the one presented in this vignette.  Patients with complex issues require outside scrutiny \u2013 a judge familiar with health care law is a good choice.",

It was the hard work of lawyers and judges over the years to ensure that basic due process rights are respected.\nMost doctors have neither the experience, expertise or training to be able to effectively balance the legal right of autonomy against a decision to require treatment.  Psychiatrists have additional training in this area that dives deep into the competency question, general medical practitioners do not.\nI spent years conducting hearings on forced medication, I developed a great respect for the medical opinions of doctors. Sometimes I would disagree with a doctor not because I disagreed with the diagnosis, but because the facts of the case did not conform to the democratically created legal standard for when a person is required to submit to forced medication. It was probably the hardest decision I would make as a judge.\n\nThe writer wants to take the decision of whether to terminate a patient's autonomy away from the legal system and give it to doctors, ethicists, and other \"relevant\" experts, which seems to leave out experts in what rights all individuals are guaranteed under the law.\nBefore those \"well meaning\" decisions of the courts it was entirely possible to be committed for decades without recourse.\nSince retiring I have been teaching courses in law and psychiatry at a medical and a law school.

        "As a retired lawyer who once worked as a public defender representing people being involuntarily committed for psychiatric treatment, I have some thoughts on this very complicated issue. 1. Under our Constitution, the government cannot deprive someone of their liberty without due process of law. This is not a process we can simply delegate to well meaning doctors whose bias is already treatment over liberty. 2. Current treatments for serious psychiatric illnesses are terrible and they mostly don\u2019t work for people with schizophrenia and the side effects are terrible. 3. Our system in Washington is highly efficient and quick. Patients must be seen in court in 72 hours and if held for treatment reviewed again in 2 weeks, 30 days, 90 days, etc. Doctors get their say and lawyers protect the rights of patients. 4. A bigger problem in my view is that the standards for commitment are too high. We wait until people injure themselves or others or are completely unable to care for themselves when earlier treatment might be more effective. 5. As a society we have decided not to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves and then complain about the chronically homeless people most of whom have drug addiction and/or serious mental illness for which we refuse to fund voluntary treatment or community support.",

Note that non-expert judges and juries are constantly ruling on things they know little about: technology and date rape, to name two. Bringing in expert witnesses is considered sufficient.\n\nImpartial panels -- maybe even a special medical and mental health branch of each state's judiciary system -- would be a nice addition to the current situation.

        "Who knows the truth? Nobody. Knowing the truth means knowing what it true, forever and in every identical case, and humans, being finite beings, cannot do that. It comes down to who can more reliably predict what will have the most desirable results for the patient. That ends up being determined not by propositional logic but by empirical proof, and in that respect even experts are only right more often than non-experts but not always. Even a board of doctors in a hospital are not unbiased for any number of potential reasons. The worst case being whether to withhold treatment that will cost the hospital greatly both in dollars and resources. \n\nThe best argument for using the courts to resolve such issues and involuntary treatment is that the courts do not care beyond returning a legally sound verdict. If there are reasonable people who object to the involuntary treatments, let them be heard along with the advocates. If not opposed, just the act of having to relate the justification compels the experts to reconsider what made them conclude as they had.\n\nIf one has ever engaged in active listening/mirroring, one becomes aware that when people hear what they have said from an external source, they suddenly see it context and understand better what they are thinking and often what they have not considered. \n\nWhen people are intensely struggling to accomplish important work, they miss things which their minds tend to fill in to confirm that they have been successful.",

Taking away someone's constitutional rights is a big deal, and it should be done by someone trained in constitutional law.  The questions in guardianship and mental commitment cases involve a balancing of people's medical needs with their rights to control their own lives.  In Wisconsin, for example, we have several different standards under which person\u2019s rights to make their own decisions can be taken away.  People in these situations have attorneys appointed to represent their wishes, and other attorneys appointed to represent their best interests.  Attorneys for the government advocate for the guardianship or commitment.  Doctors are used as experts regarding the medical issues.  Each person - doctor, government attorney, adversary counsel, guardian-ad-litem, and judge - play a role.  The idea of having doctors usurp all of these roles is authoritarian.  Doctors, or even panels of doctors, untrained in constitutional law, would be likely to reduce the issues to one simplistic question -  \u201cwhat do I think is best for this person.

A citizen's right to freedom can lawfully be severely abridged by two instititutions: police and hospitals.   Whether the removal of freedom takes place in a police lock-up or an acute-care psychiatric hospital is irrelevant.  The extreme shift in legal status from freedom to involuntary detention requires judicial review.  Judges do not make medical evaluations; they rely on psychiatrists to present medical information that will inform the decision concerning citizenship rights to freedom.  The patient's safety and clinical status are enormous considerations in these determinations, but they do not erase the need for review of the patient's legal status.  (The absence of such judicial review gives us the Soviet gulog.) \nAll of the psychiatrists I have worked with clearly understand the interplay between legal and psychiatric considerations.

The solution was a courtroom there, in the psychiatric hospital, with a judge fully knowledgeable about psychiatric issues. The patient had their own counsel, and the state was represented by theirs. Many patients, even in the hospital, refuse treatment. This means using techniques that are less than acceptable to the public. ECT was often used, and frankly, very, very effective. Then a patient would improve mentally, and start taking meds. But over and over again the scheduled court review would be canceled, the patient didn't get treatment, and got worse. And many treatments lose potency when stopped and started. And patients sent to Rikers before a court hearing were kept in a large room, their name was yelled for meds, they didn't take them and ended up right back where they started. In an expensive, and seemingly never-ending hospital stay.

The doctor must present their case and the patient has the right to a lawyer which is usually paid for by our Legal Aid system.

I had to argue my way out of the hospital last year, where I'd gone for a blood infection - I went under protest, but my husband wasn't ready for my death. I went.  I got sent home with a pic line to continue my treatment. I was a good girl, and did it carefully. Then bingo, a new blood infection. Back I went. And after a week, it too was controlled. And my husband, who is frail and we live in the woods, was not thriving. It took me three days to get them to release me - and I did it finally by getting up, dressing, and heading for the door. Why? They discovered a \"mass\" on the outside of one lung. They wanted to biopsy it, they wanted to take yet more blood tests (from veins now collapsing). They wanted to wait for this, that, and the other. I left. I will, and now my husband agrees, never go back. I'm 85. Somehow in the next days, weeks, months, my body will disconnect forever from this life. It's a big deal. But I'm a big girl. And I'm human. It happens.",

That is so far from the truth of reality, including for this very doctor in my opinion. The author concludes the article with two paragraphs about how this supposedly incompetent patient WAS able to make a decision of sound mind that was ultimately better for him than any of the options this doctor presented. \n\nMaybe instead of trying to come up with complicated work arounds to continue making paternalistic decisions as doctors, this author should spend more time listening to patients and actually working with them in whatever capacity they have to find the best solution for THEM not for the doctors.",
        "I find it somewhat confusing that he was determined to be incompetent, then signed himself on to hospice.  Perhaps I missed something.\nIf he was indeed incompetent, which as we know generally requires a psych eval and two different attending physicians to determine, a surrogate should have been appointed. New York has systems in place for a state surrogate to be appointed.  My experience is that these individuals are caring, competent and responsive to the needs of the hospital team.\nI am not sure if a judge is needed in the process of appointing a surrogate, but generally their role is just to ensure that due diligence has been followed.  Granted, appointing a surrogate can take time. It appears that this was not an emergent situation however, though I'm sure the hospital wanted him out as soon as possible.\nFinally, we can all recognize that the days of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest are gone.

Tossing them aside would be, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginzburg has said, would be akin to throwing away your umbrella because you're not getting wet.",

        "America should make it easier for authorities such as doctors to keep people diagnosed with mental illness in facilities against their will and in general make it easier to diagnose mental illness and hold such diagnosed people against their will?\n\nThe big problem as I see it is diagnosing mental illness in the first place in current America which has no clear definition of sanity and is full of incoherent thinking. People routinely accuse each other of not thinking right to the point of accusing people of being flat out immoral and they try to keep each other down to the point of not just censoring or firing people but to the point of having them confined. To make matters worse even correct thinking is considered potentially dangerous as we see in attempts to have A.I. restrained, \"to work for humanity\". Basically thinking itself whether sane or not is considered something which must be controlled and everybody is held to limits, their fields and disciplines for example, lest they \"overstep their bounds\".\n\nBut let me give an example of \"crazy\" thinking which might get me personally in trouble: America is simultaneously becoming extremely anti-Darwinian natural selection with respect to humans and Darwinian to point you have the most capable people in society overtasked in employment to make up for the many who don't pull their weight, the strong with enormous moral pressure forced to make up for the weak, a contradictory situation with no sane solution so far, thus anger.",

It would probably be decided by a judge and doctors. I have no family to chime in, so will be at the mercy of strangers. This is a frightening prospect. Every year my doctor has me complete a Medicare physical, which includes questions devised to uncover any problems with my mental state. Scary. I've decided to stop going to my doctor when I reach 75 or so. Once they determine you might be slipping that could be the end of your independence.

No one, but no one, has the power over a person's will and freedom as the doctor.

        "So did you check out any mental health  statutes doctor or you did just dive into fixing a system that mental health professionals and legal experts have struggled with for years? Doctors prescribe medication in hospital psychiatric situations that cause side effects not easily controlled in an outpatient situation. Which drugs are available on the Medicaid formulary or ones available through private insurance? Let\u2019s think for a moment on who should substitute their judgement for the patient and in what phases of treatment. Emergency situations can justify hospitalization and even forced medication under some mental health statutes, but when the patient leaves the facility who should decide what treatment should be required. Is there case management available? What other issues need to be addressed in discharge planning? All this stuff is not so simple and forgive me if I have some doubts that medical expertise in place of that of a judge who listens to all the evidence, weighs the options, and balances the liberty concerns of the individual with the needs of the community is a good idea. We should not treat\u2019em and street\u2019em but this issue presents real problems that lack easy solutions.

Instead, including multiple perspectives, such as a judge, but especially the people most at the center of concern are critical to the most effective, helpful and ethical services. In addition, prescribed drugs are helpful for many, but not required for everyone in the same way, have very difficult side effects and services must include many other services such as treatment for trauma, food, safe housing, peer and family support.\n\nShared decision making that includes the voice of the client and professionals listening with humility is vital to successful connection and lasting engagement in services.

        "Clear and well written argument for letting medical opinions stay in the realm of physicians-with patient, family (when available) nursing, social work, ethicist involvement. The tragedy of allowing people without capacity due to psychosis to harm themselves and live on the street because they have a \u201cright\u201d to do so is an excuse for not providing the care they so need, \n\nThe ending in this story demonstrates the fundamental and important role of time and mediation in resolving these sorts of dilemmas: a thank you to Nancy Dubler, a force in bioethics whose  life was recently celebrated in her NYT obituary.",
        "So a professional in a field with no proven cures, no established understanding of disease and a long history of institutional patient abuse and therapeutic fades declares that party X, like it or not, must accept his treatments....\n\nAnd no recourse if and when the treatment fails.\n\nOnly the medical industry would regard forced medical \"care\" as a good idea.",
        "The author's example is bizarre. The patient had a terminal condition, and he understood that. He didn't want to spend his last days in the hospital, and he didn't want treatment forced on him. What possible reason could there be to hold him in the hospital and treat him against his will?\n\nIt looks to me as if the system worked, and it worked partly because the patient had a legal right to challenge involuntary confinement in court.",
        "Decisions to treat without consent should be looked at by someone outside the medical establishment. Doctors, like every professional in every field, live inside the thought bubble of their field. External review means that someone who doesn't live inside this thought bubble has a chance to review. \n\nThink about this from the perspective of the patient. Patients experiencing psychosis may be wrong about their current model of the world, but they still perceive and feel and can be traumatized by involuntary treatment. The mere existence of judicial review can give comfort to patients who otherwise have no control and no external advocate.",
        "It's discouraging to read comments with a recurring theme of physicians as primarily motivated by a conspiracy of greed for money and power. Yes, those behaviors exist in a few, but to generalize this to the vast majority of physicians whose primary motivation is to work with a patient on improving health betrays unwillingness to assume good intent. Dr. Jauhar describes a thoughtful process of working with a patient whose brain was initially incapable of making a rational decision (I wonder if any commenters ever took car keys from a drunk friend). Once the patient was able to understand the ramifications of their decision the treatment plan changed accordingly. \n   An experienced physician is the person best equipped to lead a team in determining whether a patient has the capacity to make informed decisions regarding their care. An experienced judge is best equipped to determine if care can legally be forced upon a patient.\n   Dr. Jauhar may or may not have made more money by providing ongoing care for heart failure to this patient. Probably not because the patient could not reasonably be discharged with decompensated schizophrenia. The doctor did NOT make more money for taking the time to evaluate the patients mental status and to coordinate empathetic assessment of capacity for decision making while considering the most ethical current treatment.",

        "This type of thing is always difficult.  Most of the time the physician wants to do what is best for the patient.  Our history of treating mentally ill patients poorly, of betraying Black Americans when it comes to medical care, and the way we treat women makes it even harder no matter how sound the reasoning is.  \n\nIn this case it seems that the doctors made the correct decision.  The problems come when the wrong decision is made and no one backs down or apologizes for it.  That sort of thing enrages patients, their families, and anyone else who has had a similar situation.  If we, as a society, treated people with more respect and dignity perhaps these issues wouldn't come up as often as they do.",

Because the transplant programs are scored based on patient survival rates - the better their rates the more money they receive.  The effect - which should be obvious - is that fewer people receive care because the programs are unwilling to \"hurt\" their scores by performing transplants on patients that MIGHT have worse outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Jobs famously received TWO livers - despite refusing the simple surgery that would have cured him in the first place.  Money talks - which is why we need independent 3rd parties making these decisions and not hospital boards whose incentives may not be aligned with the patients.",

Doctors often disagree over a diagnosis\u2014for example, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be mistaken for other illnesses. Drug withdrawal can appear like psychosis. This would take us back to the time of getting locked up in a ward by mistake (or the whim of an incompetent doctor). Being in a mental hospital is a harrowing and traumatic experience\u2014even for those who are ill. Once you are committed it\u2019s very hard to get out.

I was aware that there are strict requirements regarding restraints for patience in a bed, did not know about the wheelchair thing. Apparently patients are more likely to injure themselves being restrained than not.  I'd have to see the research, but I feel these two situations are similar.

They didn\u2019t  care how much it cost, they didn\u2019t care what the ramifications for the family were, they just wanted to apply the best treatment. What\u2019s wrong with that? Well, if treating a mild condition with zillion dollar costs drives a family into homelessness, they didn\u2019t acknowledge any responsibility.

If anything, this example shows how easy it is for internal ethical mechanisms to bow to institutional convenience. \n\nIt also demonstrates a problematic imbalance between how easy it is to deliver advanced emergency care, and how difficult to provide long-term support.",

Because this docket hears relatively few cases, judgements are usually speedy, and because judges stay on the docket, they develop deep knowledge on the issues. \n\nTo my mind, something similar is a better idea than what the author proposes. What a judge offers is not simply independent review, but independent *judicial*  review. Judges have a different set of priorities than people in the medical community. While the health of the patient is very important to a judge, a judge also takes into account the impact on society, the interests of the state and so on. While that may be frustrating to those whose priorities are focused on the individual (it is sometimes very frustrating to me as a social worker), review from outside the field of medicine can produce better, sustainable outcomes. \n\nBut that's only when the judge does, in fact, know about medicine and mental health, and when the judgements are timely, which is why a specialized docket with trained judges is necessary. I agree with the author that the current system is too slow and relies on judges unable to understand the relevant facts.",

(Ignore for the moment the very obvious reality that medication cannot change our beliefs or make us happy or pleasant.) I understand why Big Medicine likes the idea of giving the patient an injection every month and why Big Pharma especially does but do patients love these treatments? Imagine if you were told you needed a shot ever to be \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nEven if a judge says a patient must have a mind-altering chemical injected into their body every month, should a doctor or nurse really be holding a patient down and forcing a needle into a person\u2019s body to execute a judge\u2019s order? Would you do this? When the authors talk about the horror story of forced electroconvulsive therapy, don\u2019t they realize that the belief we can use electricity to cause seizures is just one point on a slippery slope?\n\nOnce upon a time, I might have trusted physicians but seeing as how doctors have sold-out to insurers and employers and how willing docs are to ration care in 10-minute appointment blocks, I\u2019m going to hold off on believing their first concern is for the patient.",
        "Leaving decisions to potentially permanently institutionalize people in the hands of corporate agents who profit directly from depriving them of their liberty  is not a good idea.  \n\nThe judicial decision model is imperfect, but at least the judges are not profiting by depriving people of their liberty.  And people have the right to appeal their decisions.",
        "\"The sort of abuse dramatized in the 1975 movie \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d with its harrowing depiction of forced electroconvulsive therapy, is far less common.\"\n\nThis is because of the judicial review.\n\nBut the author is right in one sense. Times have changed.  But he doesn't mention how they've changed in a negative manner.  Doctors don't have the time, energy or resources to give full consideration for our healthcare let alone decisions like these.\n\nI do not want an under-resourced, exhausted doctor who only has 15- 30 minutes to consider my case to make decisions about my health without my consent.",
        "The problem is with autonomy, consent and the problem that consent cannot be obtained if the patient cannot understand the risks and benefits of treatment. \n\nPatients without health care proxies can find themselves being denied care they need, or denying themselves  care they need because they cannot make an informed decision.\n\nThe person of group who assumes responsibility cannot be  the people who either will profit or lose money based on the decision.  I'd rather a judge or a formal committee not associated with the hospital  be the arbiters.\n\nI don't like to think we'd deny care because Medicaid reimbursement for psychiatric care is too little, or because the procedure being recommended pays really well.",
        "The poor already receive inferior medical care. I can easily imagine a patient with excellent insurance being held for psychiatric treatment while a patient with the same affliction, but insufficient funds, is discharged without a second thought.\n\nAs many others have stated, money and medical treatment shouldn't go hand in hand. The entire system needs to be revamped to offer fair treatment and protections.",
        "Let\u2019s see.  The for profit  because non profit is a joke gets to make a decision but the corporations employees and the corporation itself is shielded from liability like judges.   How about if the decision is proven to be erroneous all the professionals involved have their licenses revoked and the facility is closed",
        "Eh.  My wife and I both work in a mental health crisis unit.  She as an ARNP and me a counselor.  The speed of the hearings can be frustrating but you're overstating the issue. \n\nAnd while the One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest scenario is, indeed, no longer a thing (if it ever was) the system is not immune from all sorts of bad incentives. \n\nWe're talking about the core freedoms of citizens here.  We routinely take our patients physical liberty.  This simply has to remain court ordered.  The state has to remain the only authority that can commit someone as the state has hundreds of years of procedures for appeal. \n\nI'm all for expanding our ability to hold the most vulnerable patients longer and expediting the process and we desperately need at least a five fold increase in long term beds but the problems you site are necessary limits on our authority.  Our hearings are done by video for instance but a medically run process will inevitably involve administration and none of us can fully trust the incentive structure of even not for profit orgs, to say nothing of for profit hospitals. \n\nThe current system is, by far, the least bad option.",
        "This is about oversight. When there is an external party overseeing the doctors, it leads to less abuse of the system. The author is arguing basically for abolishing oversight over involuntary comittals.",
        "The job of a Doctor is to do No Harm. If the patient is fortunate to have a good medical practitioner;  what they do is mostly treat symptoms!  That being said, Doctors & patients need to remember, Doctors are not Gods!",
        "All that hand wringing for a patient that was doomed from the outset. Dr. Jauhar chose a poor example to make the case for involuntary medical interventions of mentally ill people. If said patient was deemed sane, refusing treatment for any reason would be his right. Mental illness is poorly defined, and even less understood. The medications used to control are merely pacifiers, with adverse side effects  that many patients can\u2019t tolerate. So who should be allowed to allowed to deprive a mentally ill person of her constitutional rights, Nurse Ratched or the judge?",
        "Absolutely not. Doctors reap financial benefits from caging and drugging their \u201cpatients\u201d. The most vulnerable among them - POC, the very young and very old, the poor, etc. - will be suffer the most. And, in the long run, psychiatry will suffer, too. If a psychiatric label, which one can receive in under 15 minutes, can be used to scrap all of a person\u2019s rights for as long as they live, psychiatry will lose almost all of its voluntary patients. The medical careers of psychiatrists will end and be replaced with careers in law enforcement. Be careful what you wish for, Dr. Jauhar.",
        "Neither doctors nor judges have the right to inflict \"care\" on non-consenting patients.\n\nIt is already too easy to detain someone against their will and inflict involuntary care on them.\n\nThis writer believes that they have the right to force another human to remain locked in a cage and pumped full of medication without any regard for their own autonomy. They should be kept away from patients until they learn to respect the humanity of others.",
        "If it was me, I'd want a judge, not a doctor. Judges have experience making decisions based on complicated and often conflicting facts.",
        "\u201c\u202695 percent or more of requests for treatment over objection are approved by judges\u2026\u201d\n\nThis statistic fails to capture the number of cases which are never brought to judges because they would be an abuse of patient autonomy. While I agree with many of the points made, I think it\u2019s important to note that asking the court to weigh in on such a matter is less about asking the court to practice medicine and more about having some external oversight of physicians (who are overwhelmingly well intentioned but not always). Abuses by physicians against their patients are not entirely a thing of the past, the difference today is that they are not perceived as a necessary evil or a permissible attribute of the role. Many of the laws and codes which were established to assure that may now seem dated or obsolete but we should not let them fall victim to that success.",
        "How about the recent discoveries of patients at teaching hospitals being subjected to invasive \"exams\" (that often just happen to involve sexual features of an unconscious person) without consent.  It's not forcing a treatment on someone who rejects or won't comply but rather engaging in treatments on someone unaware, competent, and very likely certain to reject the offer. \n\nDistinguishing between these actions seem obvious, but one is certainly hard for the courts and the other hard for the doctors to sufficiently understand and do the ethical thing.",
        "I cannot speak to other states but in Pennsylvania a person who s felt to be an imminent risk to themselves or others can be held for up to 72 hours for psychiatric evaluation.  The process does not require a judge. If the person needs ongoing care the treatment team can petition to extend the commitment period, but a hearing is heard and the person has a right to have to representation. \nInvoluntary commitment is often confused with being declared \u201cincompetent.\u201d   This a legal term and is determined by a judge.",
        "If we are going to follow the science, then we must do so across the entire medical profession, and not just pick and choose. \n\nThat is the overall problem regardless of this particular one. \n\nWe do not have a health care system. We have a health insurance triage system which (sometimes by said court order) leads to some sort of health care, ONLY to stabilize. That is essentially the law if you walk into any ER. \n\nWe also know that the first thing to go in the last half century or so has been mental health care as those large warehouses have been dismantled and has relegated everyone to the streets. It is now law enforcement and social workers and lawyers and judges that are unequipped to deal with the mass number of people needing help. \n\nThe thing is that a lot of cost effective solutions for preemptive care (that costs little in the scheme of things) balloons out of proportion until said lawyers and judges get involved. \n\nSure, import some of the solutions and ideas in the article, but like all social problems, we are simply looking at a fraction of the problem that requires an all of the above solution. \n\nSingle payer would be a start.",
        "A \"responsible adult\" or a \"guardian ad litem\" should make the decision on behalf of the patient.   Not a doctor or an employee of the hospital or healthcare provider.  \n\nSometimes,  a public interest or NGO is required in order to ensure that the decision is made in the patient's and the  public's best interest.  Capitalists do not like it, of course,  and doctors are understandably demoralized by being placed in the position of last-man-standing in the way of a disastrous bureaucratic decision.",
        "Wait in America? That's funny because for the last 40-45 years since the rise of HMOs corps, they have been deciding healthcare - not doctors.",
        "This issue would be a lot less thorny if you took the profit motive out of our health care system.  Incentives are crucial and people are often incapable of separating their own motivations- that is even knowing why they make a decision when it involves multiple rewards.\n\nCapitalism and healthcare need to be separated from each other to assure patients are being treated the right way for the right reasons.\n\nHowever, money is power and creating a health care system based on the public good is close to impossible in our money warped form of democracy."
