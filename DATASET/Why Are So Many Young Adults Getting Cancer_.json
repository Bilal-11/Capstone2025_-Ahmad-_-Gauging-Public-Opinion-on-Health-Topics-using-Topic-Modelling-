With 8 billion humans we are drowning in our own wastes instead of living sustainably. So this is just a natural response, and there will be more of this. Actions have consequences.",
        "Hmmm..let's see..was there an experimental drug given to billions of people in the last 4-5 years that was developed at warp speed to save the world? Of course that wouldn't have anything to do with it, kinda like that drug stopped the virus propagation in its tracks according to Ms Maddow.",

        "How about a thorough and unbiased look into the cellphone usage which has exploded onto the scene in the last 30 years?  I can\u2019t think of a bigger change that has happened to this country and even the world-  the rapid switch to cellular technology and the internet; the rapid move to wireless technology may contain hidden dangers.",
        "While it's partly speculation, of course, the fact is that we are doused in a chemicals to an extent that would have been inconceivable when I was young 50 years ago (and we were hardly chemical free!). Many or most of these chemicals haven't been tested sufficiently for carcinogenity, and even if they have been, the effect of exposure to *multiple* chemicals, each with low carcinogenic potential, has to be taken into account.\n\nI read the other day that each of us has a -- get this -- teaspoon of microplastics in our brains.\n\nWe're living in a chemical stew. Other factors such as obesity may play a role, but I'm placing a bet on chemical exposure as a major one.",
        "The fact that the rate of cancer in younger people increases slightly with each generation is one that deserves longitudinal multi-factored research.  Several of the concerns RFKJr has raised are identified as possible explanations for this scary trend.\nUnder the current chaotic administration, the funds to conduct the necessary research to address these concerns are being axed.  The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing; there is little cohesiveness in this administration.  The cutting off of research funds regarding health is extremely concerning to me and I suspect millions of others.",
        "Eat healthy, sleep well, exercise\u2026 practice yoga/meditation to lower stress. \n\nStill diagnosed with cancer. \n\nIt seems to me that our society has been working for years to create an environment that encourages cancer.  It is indeed a perfect storm of our own creation.  \n\nI try to remember\u2026 each moment in this human form is a gift and tomorrow is not promised.",
        "In demography we have the competing-risks hypothesis.  Of course many more people are dying of cancers than in the past is due to the fact that they are less likely to die early of parasites, infectious disease, even accidents.  That means more people die of cancer overall.\n\nThe fact that each cohort has greater rates of cancer morbidity and mortality may or may not be a huge source of concern, and deserves more study.  It may be that the \"easy\" reductions in population mortality achieved through public health and antibiotics may be at an end.  It's time to start dealing with the harder problem of cleaning up the environment.",

A hundred years ago if you examined a human, you wouldn\u2019t have found plastic in their system. Now it\u2019s uniformly present. We have no idea what the effects of that continuing and growing exposure will be, but I will go with: not good.",

Destroying the nation's health system aligns with Trump's overall strategy of destroying the country.     Don't hold your breath waiting on Kennedy.",
        "I find it ridiculous that Dr. Lamas hypothesizes about the good that RFK could do. Perhaps this is just lip service, because only damage and destruction will ensue from RFK's policies (a conundrum) like anything else associated with his capo.",
        "While I agree with the sentiments of this article, it assumes wrongly that politicians like Secretary Kennedy were appointed or elected by people who are unafraid of the truths revealed or discredited by mainstream science, which unfortunately is not true. \n\nIf you want politicians who support the findings of mainstream science, vote for Democrats. The Republican Party and Republican voters no longer care about what science says, they only care about how they want it to make them feel.",
        "It's unfortunate that we're not allowed to talk about the largest immune-system destroying event of the past 100 years.\n\nIt's true that young adult cancers have been on the rise since well before COVID, but given the damage that COVID can due to a person's immune system, I would be surprised if it wasn't accelerating the problem.",
        "Purely correlation, but I'm going with an increase in obesity and pro-inflammatory diet.",
        "There was no references or actual data in this opinion so I found and read a 2023 JAMA paper that reported the \"incidence rate of early-onset cancer was 99.96 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2010 and 102.97 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2019\" for people under 50. It also noted a drop in incidence over that time period for men and a drop in people over 50. This study has complicated results. Here is a quote:\n\n\"During the study period, the incidence rates of early-onset cancers increased in female individuals but declined in male individuals; this increase among female individuals was mainly due to cancers of the uterus and breast. By race and ethnicity, there was an increased incidence of early-onset cancer in American Indian or Alaska Native people, Asian or Pacific Islander people, and Hispanic people. However, the incidence of early-onset cancers remained stable among White people and declined among Black people.\"",
        "Look at what a lot of young people eat and drink and their lifestyle choices. Recreation consists of sitting for hours playing video games. Sleep patterns are basically play or work until drinking a constant stream of chemical filled energy drinks lose their effect. Fast food, obesity off the charts, a lack of being proactive about checkups all add up. How about all those microbrew drinks? Environmental factors like micro plastics and hormones in food and water could also contribute. My parents and aunts and uncles in my life likely got cancer from common dangers in mid century America, leaded gas, diesel bus fumes, pesticides, prevalent air pollution from coal burning and just working in factories loaded with asbestos and formaldehyde and of course smoking and a heavy red meat diet. The more things change...",
        "After at least 40 years in Medicine, between my training and my practice, I am convinced that the Cancer diagnoses in young patients has to be multi-factorial and may be very hard to investigate by traditional measures.\n\nAlcohol (as Ethanol, the form socially used) is very likely to contribute to Cancer and Juvenile Obesity will not help things as \n\nObesity has been found to be a factor in any of a number of cancers as well. [Uterine endometrial, Gastric Cancer of the Cardia segment, Kidney, Liver, Colorectal, Gall Bladder and Thyroid among others]\n\nUV exposure has been known for some time as well as Tobacco/Marijuana.\n\nViral infections including Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, HIV, Ebstein-Barr Virus and HPV. \n\nIt has been noted that Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria causing Ulcer can cause Gastric Cancer, MALT Lymphomas, Pancreatic and perhaps Colorectal Cancer.    H. pylori is not at all unknown in young children!\n\nMany chemicals are present in processed foods which may have some potential for causing problems, though far from any proof being made for even some clear suggestion.\n\nI worry about microplastics which can cause inflammation and cell death as well as causing DNA damage and altering hormone levels.   Who knows whether any link to this might be justified or not?\n\nThere are huge numbers of factors which might cause cancer which remain hard to study and yet possible.\n\nMan has a great deal to learn when it comes to cancer risks!",

        "3M.  The PFA\u2019s they developed in the seventies are now EVERYWHERE.  In the food, in the water, in our cells, in our reproductive systems, endocrine systems\u2026\u2026no one can escape these chemicals.  It took researchers years to find a population group that did not test positive for PFAs.  Read the ProPublica investigative piece about it.  They are forever.  And it is a crime against humanity that they knew and yet they allowed them to spiral out of their control.  They even found them in their pet horse.  The money was too good, and the employees needed their retirement\u2026\u2026",

        "Diet, diet, and diet. And the diet of their parents.  It is generational inflammation brought on by obscene amounts of animal products and processed foods.  Human bodies are failing earlier than ever under the strain of it.  Humans are herbivores with cow teeth and cow intestines. Eat the standard American Diet and your body will try to fight it with inflammation.  Eat Whole Foods, plant based - scientifically proven to reduce illnesses, including cancer - and you will be pain free, sleep like a baby, handle stress better, improve mental health, and free of disease. Look up Dr. Brooke Goldner.",
        "Very sensible analysis. Thank you!",
        "Hmmm. What do younger generations have that older generations do (did) not have? Children get 15-20 vaccines for as many diseases. Why does the author feel that researching possible long-term vaccine harms is not just as important as other the environmental impacts they have listed?",
        "Too many chemicals and plastics in everything, which is not only affecting younger people but it seems like there's more and more cancer in older folks too. I lost 5 friends within 3 months last year, all men and women in their 60's, all otherwise healthy people. It's too much. There's something really wrong at the root of it. Could all of the beaucoup $$$ being made on drugs and treatment and funerals have anything to do with it?? Dunno, but there's definitely a lot more cancer now than ever before. But let's spend more money on wars and elections instead, that's working out really well.",
        "The lifestyle, the bad food and the environment. All are toxic.",
        "Perhaps hospitals and clinics should stop requiring a \"friend\" or family to drive you home after a colonoscopy. Many of us are alone.  They are rooted in the dark ages.  An uber could easily drop you off.  Further, I don't even use anesthesia, so what's their excuse?  They act like we all live in the dark ages when everyone was married and lived with extended family.",
        "My Mother's generation is living longer that any other in recent history, I know because I read the obits. Routinely they reach 102 years old in my local paper, in a middle class city. I noticed that her generation, and she is in her early 90's and lives on her own, as many of them do, never even considered taking their own lives or causing themselves harm. But these younger generations have done lots of Tide pod challenges, etc. Forever plastics are not the enemy. I remember a time when glass and metal dominated the soda and beer market. Broken glass was everywhere. Plastics allowed women to throw away their ironing boards and irons, with the advent of polyester. What is causing the cancer in these young folks can't be something that was around from the 1930s when Mom's generation was born. It has to be something else. By the way, her generation loves loves loves ice cream.",
        "One word: plastics.",
        "Chemicals.  Not very difficult to figure out",
        "Why younger and younger people are getting more cancer -- colon cancer for example -- surely is a question susceptible to the sort of rigorous analysis that has informed research on heart disease.  We hear a lot about things that may cause cancer -- alcohol, ultra-processed food, etc., but, until someone studies thousands of younger people afflicted with cancer, along with controls of the same age who are not so afflicted, in terms of dozens of lifestyle parameters, we will not know the answer(s).\n\nArticles on this topic would be more informative if they reported on some of the research being done, rather than speculating on possible causes.  For instance, alcohol is known to contribute to a risk of cancer, but people drink less alcohol than they used to, not more.  The same is true of tobacco, a known carcinogen.  Whatever is causing the increase in cancer among young adults must be something new?  What about high fructose corn syrup?  A lack of fiber in the diet?  Chemicals leaching from plastic containers?  Microplastics?  I can speculate too, but I'd like to know what the best minds are studying as possible causes and what they actually know.",
        "One thing that seems to rarely be talked about when discussing the causes of cancer is infectious agents. The HPV vaccine has effectively eliminated the risk of cervical cancer in females and certain oral cancers in males. This is a stunning public health success story that has not received the attention it deserves, in my opinion.",
        "Dr. Lamas is on point in this essay.\n\nA point that didn't come up, but should be a part of any proposed studies is chronic exposure to environmental and occupational toxins.\n\nMany physicians are NOT trained in these specialties and in toxicology.  As a result, many physicians are placed in a position of having to make a referral to a specialist in an area outside of their education, advanced training, and work experience.\n\nWhen the patient gets to the so called right specialist, the odds are increased on having a favorable outcome.\n\nThese medical cases are difficult to handle, especially if there isn't any family history suggesting heredity.  Narrowing down to where the patient was exposed to an environmental or an occupational toxin can sometimes facilitate the accuracy of the diagnosis and enable treatment to start sooner.",
        "I grew up near an oil and gas refinery. Back then, nobody thought much about it unless they were burning off gas, which was quite spectacular. Two kids I grew up with developed glioblastomas, one in her early twenties and the other in his late thirties. I've wondered if there was a relationship.\n\nMy mother was enrolled in a study on the effects of arsenic in well water. Both she and her brother had bladder cancer at young ages, as did several others in the small town she grew up in. It was natural but was found to be deadly.\n\nBut I'm sure the Trump administration, which is stomping on medical research, scorning tested and effective treatments for many diseases, and threatening to take away various healthcare benefits, will find \"healthy\" treatments and cures for all maladies. For a price. Which may be your life.",
        "would it be possible to cross reference the data with those in the amish community? or other communities who still grow their own food, limit social media etc? I think it would help narrow down which aspects of modern culture are actually killing us",
        "Many, if not most, cancers are simply a feature of life. Errors are made in cell replication that lead to mutations- the majority of which are benign but some lead to cancer. This has been found in the fossil record, hundreds of million years before any man made synthetic chemicals or other exposures. Is it wise to limit potential exposure pathways - of course, but it is not guaranteed to prevent one from getting cancer.",
        "The author posits that younger people are getting cancers at increased rates due to the cumulative effects of toxins they've been exposed to. So, if I'm in my 70's and have never had cancer, and have been around far longer and thus exposed to more toxins by living in the same world, then why doesn't my age group have statistically equal or even more cancers?",
        "One thing I will never understand about human nature is the reluctance to screen and test. Most insurance covers it. Most people avoid it. The fear of finding out seems to be the most frequent answer. I just do not understand. Is a Pap smear uncomfortable? absolutely. Is a monogram briefly uncomfortable, even painful? sure. Even colonoscopies are no longer necessary in young people, swab some poop and mail it in for goodness sakes. For a few minutes of discomfort you get peace of mind, or\u2026.early detection and saving your life. I just don\u2019t get the rhetoric around avoiding screening. Just do it.",

        "The question for me and others in my group of conversationalists, is \"how much.\" How many cocktails, how much fast food, how much harmful air to breathe? What exactly is \"sedentary\" lifestyle? We know that moderation in all the above probably puts us in a better position not get cancer. But it's such an odd, invasive disease, it's not surprising that people just go on living and not worrying so much. Clearly, life is a risk for cancer.",
        "Decades ago while I was working on my PhD in Medical Anthropology (Dietary Fat and Benign Breast Disease), nutritionists were advising eating a wide variety of food groups, not to get a variety of nutrients but to spread out our risks of  carcinogens, contaminants from any one food. (A type of gallows humor, there.)\n\nBut it's even worse now. Now I'm warned of microplastics in tea bags. OK, I have no problems brewing directly from tea leaves (until they also  prove toxic). But not wanting to be wasteful, can I risk using up the tea bags already in my cupboard?",
        "poor timing with all the cuts in science, CDC, FDA, universities, etc.",
        "Interesting. I wonder if there's any other things that could be causing the cancer increase. Anything at all. Maybe something novel, that was introduced into a huge segment of the population about 4 years ago. Any idea? Nope. Nothing.\nNo ideas.\n\nOh well. Hopefully big pharma can come up with a cure for the cancer problem. They always save us.",

The incidents may be related to how these various \u201cfactors\u201d interact with each other in specific individuals.  Cell phone usage? Non-stick surfaces?  Packaging?  Residues? Air quality?

        "As someone who was recently diagnosed with early onset cancer of a very rare type, I know quite well it was not my diet or weight that caused it. I cook healthy, vegetable focused food at home, avoid sugar, and exercise regularly. I practice stress management techniques. I do all the right things. And I am not the only one. I know other people in my circle of acquaintances have been diagnosed in the past 4 years, that are under 50 and healthy. There is something else profoundly wrong that is causing this increase. I believe strongly that environmental factors are the cause\u2014 from pesticides to microplastics to air quality to smoke inhalation from wildfires to water quality. None of these things are ever given any weight in these articles about early cancer and I am  beyond frustrated. I cannot control most of these environmental factors. I need the government to step in and research and regulate so that I can protect my child from having to go through what I have gone through.",

I don't have any of the known risk factors for my cancer: genetic conditions like Lynch syndrome, chronic bowel diseases, alcoholism, diet with lots of cured meats. I don't even fall into the demographic categories more likely to have this disease. Just pure bad luck. \n\nMy bad luck stopped at my diagnosis, though: everything since then has been as good of news as possible, presumably at least in part because I AM so much younger than most patients with my cancer. We caught it early, it hadn't spread to my lymph nodes or metastasized elsewhere in my body, I tolerated chemo well and recovered relatively easily from my Whipple, the curative surgery for my disease, and I am currently NED (no evidence of disease) six months after surgery.",

You can yell at me at what I'm about to say, but we went about the global crisis that hit five years ago exactly wrong. Except for the specifically vulnerable populations in that case, especially the elderly, it was our overwhelmingly restrictive reaction, not the virus itself, that made things worse. That played on top of our already existing obesity crisis and severe problem with ultra-processed food to make us even sicker. However carefully worded, I salute the author's delicate endorsement of the supposedly rogue appointees of the otherwise troubling new administration who do have some insight into our actual severe health problems, whether in her field of specialty or not.

Agree that the data show that each successive generation is getting cancer at an earlier age. And the rise in ultraprocessed food and chemicals from fossil fuels have grown dramatically since the 1950s at the same rate as cancers. Evidence is solid that many chemicals and pesticides can increase risk of cancer. \n\nI do not agree with the anti vaccine stance of MAHA. but they also raise serious and legitimate concerns about chemicals in foods and air and water.

        "It's very sad.  My old roommate had gotten diagnosed with testicular cancer when he was only 25.  It came out of nowhere and was completely unexpected.  He generally dismissed any pain he was feeling at the time based on the general idea of \"be a man and deal with it,\" but it turned out he actually had a disease that traditionally rarely effects people this young.  He got through the cancer, but unfortunately now, he's completely obsessed with the fear that it will come back or he could have some new kind of cancer.  He spent almost all of his spare time trying to find \"symptoms\" such as his parents telling him that his skin looked a bit more yellow or his stomach hurting a bit.  He would visit an oncologist monthly and when the oncologist told him he's fine, he took it as a sign that the oncologist was incompetent and not giving him thorough enough screening.  He moved out last month because he was so worried that doctors in this area were not as competent as the doctors that he visited when he was living with his parents.

        "Graphs of US Noncommunicable Diseases 1950-2024 show that Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, NAFLD, Type 1 Diabetes, Heart Disease, Cancer, Depression, Anxiety, Asthma, Chronic Kidney Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Autoimmune Disease, PCOS, Autism - all show sharp increases at the same time. \n\nWhich is more likely, that each has its own cause and they coincidently coincide, or that one, increasingly dominant, cause is behind all of them? \n\nAlthough at first glance it seems unlikely that these disparate conditions have the same cause, I have written a ten-minute summary detailing the physiological mechanisms causing these diseases. I have submitted it to the three most used AI sites and they all say that it is accurate, unique and important.\n\nI have submitted it to numerous researchers and no one disagrees - because no one will read it.",
        "Glysophates the pesticides came on the scene in 1974. They are hormone disruptors and have been proven to cause cancer (having had breast cancer i've done my research) , the use of sewage on crops, hormones pumped into cows, genetically modified crops that are double doused with glysophates are all causing Cancer. It irks me when people talk about alcohol and lifestyle. Newsflash, nobody in the generation before me got cancer except my grandma who died of lung cancer from smoking and they all drank like fish. Obesity can in no way account for all of the cancer happening , it's a contributing factor but give me a break. Laws that protect the food supply and polution are what is needed, not telling people not to have a margharita.",
        "Dr. L, thanks for this.\n\nThe internal contradiction between \u2018MAHA\u2019, and radical disassembly of a Federal national research and regulatory network aimed at decreasing exposure to carcinogens known, suspected and yet-to-be-discovered is achingly, glaringly obvious. \n\nCan you comment on this?",
        "No need to worry about environmental exposures because EPA is cutting all of its research programs. Kind of like, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. It will be interesting to see if NIEHS is similarly gutted.",
        "There are lots of studies on the connection between Vitamin D and cancer. The conclusions are variable, but there seems to strong evidence of a link between low Vitamin D levels and breast and colorectal cancers. \n\nA cheap and simple blood test for Vitamins D should be routine for everyone. Many Americans are deficient, especially as we avoid the sun and use sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. \n\nWith monitoring by your physician, a Vitamin D3 supplement can raise your level to a healthy range.",
        "I am not an MD.  I do have a background in scientific research. There are things I have noticed over the last 40 years that have alarmed me when it comes to our health.  \n\n1.  There's a lot more junk food out there.\n2. More children and teens are overweight than should be.  In addition, they are not as active as we were when we were children.\n3.  Our food has many more chemicals and the farmers, at least the large ones don't seem inclined to stop adding antibiotics as a fattening agent to cattle feed.  \n4.  Pesticides are known to interfere with insect endocrine systems.  Therefore those same pesticides probably affect us.\n5.  People are told that sports drinks are better than water.  That's an outright lie.  If we are not competing at a very high level we don't need sports drinks.  Water will do.  \n6.  All of us need more time to exercise.  Children need to learn about activities they can do on their own once they are adults and out of school.\n7.  We need more safe, well maintained public facilities so people don't feel they have to join a Y, a JCC, or a gym to get the exercise they need.\n8.  Recess ought to be part of every school day.  Children need to run around.  So do adults.",
        "Please, Kennedy knows nothing about medicine. He just loves garbage that he promotes and that lots of pod casters promote though very few have any medical education or knowledge including Kennedy.  \n\nThe Federal Medicl agencies are now run by an essentailly blind man to medicine and science thanks to Trump and the GOP including at least one doctor on the committee who voted for Kennedy.  That doctor should lose his medical license as far as I am concerned.",
        "yes, why are so many young people so sick?  I have never seen so many young people with serious illnesses.  Sure lifestyle has something to do with it.  But that's not the whole story. \n\n Our food is making us sick!   Talk to any immigrant and they will tell you how much our food affects their bodies, their mood, their weight, everything...",
        "For colorectal cancer, a big part of the problem is urologist's insistence in the US on using colonoscopies as the \"gold star\" test for colon cancer - even though there is no evidence that this saves lives over other, less invasive and less costly tests.  Colonoscopies require you to adhere to a special diet for several days and fast/take a hard to drink liquid to clear  before hand, to be sedated, and to go to a specialist.  They also require you to have someone to pick you up and lose a day of work (because my work relies me to be sharp and I can react strongly to sedative, I scheduled so I had two days off).  There is a non-zero chance of complication or death.  They cost about $1000.  Urologists don't even want to talk to you about other options because \"you can do that at your GP's,\" i.e. they don't make money from it.   Meanwhile, there are stool tests which are mailed to you so you can do at home with no prep, drop off at your GP's. No time off work.  Much less expensive.  Non-invasive. With these you only do the more invasive test if you're positive.   These are routinely used in Europe.  It's only in the US where everyone is expected to get a colonoscopy.",
        "The data on how fossil fuel chemicals through air pollution, plastic pollution, petrochemical pollution, pesticides, PFAS, phthalates, phenols and parabens is not \"meager.\"",
        "Here's a thought: get the profit makers OUT of medical research. Everytime I read an article in the NIH library published in the US, I scroll down to the funding section. Last article I read about an issue that affected me, the researchers had ties to 12 pharmaceutical companies. I immediately disregarded the findings.",
        "Good article. I agree that we are terribly behind in the kind of cancer research needed today. In the past 30 years, the treatment has remained basically the same with few innovations. Sure some new drugs but not an answer on a more basic level. People distrust the pharmaceutical companies because they are so pointedly after money. \nThe Universities have been a terrible disappointment also.  \nWe\u2019re missing something at a more basic level. Why are so many younger people getting cancer? What is causing this mutation to their cells? \nMuch of the research money has been misused. It did need a reset! \nIt\u2019s disheartening to find out that the heads of these organizations are getting paid millions of dollars. Why? \nI\u2019m talking about the CEOs of all these groups that are sending me requests for donations! Where is my money going? To research or to pay these executives? \nSomething is wrong with the whole system.",
        "Looking for a rational approach to any problem is not in the interests for our current government.  After all, any slowly progressing disease that takes months to years to kill people isn\u2019t anywhere near the focus of this administration.\n\nSo, if we want answers to how things like this come about, and how to mitigate those causes, we need to wait for at least three years and nine months to even start to get a better clue.  That is when an even slightly more rational administration could occupy the White House.  And, if Trump runs for an unconstitutional third term* and wins, add another four more years to that timeline.  Heck, even if Vance wins in 2028, we may have to wait another four years to see progress.",
        "We need hard, double-blind tested science if we're going to promote such a drastic new public policy.  Just because you say it's so, doesn't mean that it's so.",
        "Yes, we need science to guide us.  But science is not miracle.  Research scientists, by and large, are sensible, smart, well-informed hard-working people seeking to answer questions nobody yet can answer \u2014 seeking new knowledge.  But their work is, by definition, always in the wilderness just beyond the current limits of human knowledge.  So, yes, we need to listen to science, but also be prepared to change course as new discoveries emerge and old \"facts\" are revised.  Science is a fallible human endeavor, yet still the most reliable guide we have.",
        "How about the nutrition guidelines get changed from the amount need to survive to the amount needed to thrive?\n\nHow about screening for known genetic issues?\nVitamin D levels are controversial...except that there is an agreement that levels in single digits are common in certain patients presenting with cancer and likely contribute to the growth.   What if people were screened early in their life so they know their bodies can't make enough? Its less than $150/person now to investigate genes involved in methylation. Cheap to have a supplement, cheaper than surgery/chemo & supporting the family after mom dies.\n\nHow about women with dense breasts get screened before 40? How about ultrasound follow up  of those with dense breasts return to being 100% covered, with no out of pocket cost. \n\nSo many cheap simple things that would save lives and families.",
        "More cancer research makes sense, but the scientific research cuts happening now means no increase in cancer research.",
        "Too bad Trump and his toadies have cut research funding at great American universities, and threaten to cut more.\nLess research will be done.\nMore people will die.\nTop-notch scientists will flee to Europe.\nRepublican Red State Senators will grovel before Trump, pleading that he continue to fund their overall not-so-great universities. \n\n On the bright side, there will be lower taxes for billionaires.\nYou get what you pay for.",
        "It seems obvious that Mr. Kennedy does not understand data and is therefore unlikely to promote any verifiable research of any kind. Most Americans are never taught to discount data sets with small numbers of participants - which is why they assume incorrect assumptions. \n\nRecommending cancer screening to many in which insurance doesn't cover screening could be why only 20% of Americans have followed through.\n\nWhy have not read more about the correlation between the age of a parent and their likelihood to have a child with autism?",
        "When it comes to cancer nothing makes sense. I knew two sisters, one who ate organic foods only, the other a smoker, heavy drinker and fast food eater. The organic lifestyle was afflicted with cancer. Much of our country lives on fast foods and bottled waters and sodas. Remarkable the cancer rates are as low as they are.",
        "Dr. Lamas still believes that Mr. Kennedy can be persuaded by facts and reason.  Unfortunately that does not appear to be true.\n\nKennedy is a true ideologue and no amount or quality of evidence will dissuade him from his irrational beliefs.\n\nHis antipathy to vaccines will inevitably result in many easily avoided deaths and severe illnesses.  He will never admit he is wrong in this antipathy, no matter how many people it sickens and kills.  \n\nI wish I had a rational basis for believing that our health system will survive this administration but I try not to engage in unscientific wishful thinking."
