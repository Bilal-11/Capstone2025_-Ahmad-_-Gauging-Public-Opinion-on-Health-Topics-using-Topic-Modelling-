        "An excellent and inspiring piece.  The author is to be commended.  \n\nBut reading between the lines, financial security appears to be the bedrock upon which  a diagnosis of dementia can be greeted with any level of optimism.  How many with Alzheimer's can only dread the future and its impact on their loved ones?",
        "Everyone who has dementia travels a different path. My husband lived and died with Alzheimer's and Lewy Body dementia... with grace, curiosity and joy. He embraced his diagnosis and did what he could to erase the stigma of this life-limiting disease, including writing about it. If you want to know what his experience was like (and mine), read our book: Alzheimer's Canyon: One Couple's Reflections on Living with Dementia. I miss him every day.",

        "There is some scientific evidence that the daily consumption of turmeric can reduce the chances of getting getting Alzheimer. See <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781139\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781139</a>/\n \nIn India, most people consume turmeric in at least one dish every day. The fact that fewer Indians get Alzheimer does not necessarily prove that it because of turmeric. But turmeric has many other desirable properties. Here is an excerpt from the article whose link I have provided above.\n\n\"Curcumin (turmeric) as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and lipophilic action improves the cognitive functions in patients with AD. A growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress, free radicals, beta amyloid, cerebral deregulation caused by bio-metal toxicity and abnormal inflammatory reactions contribute to the key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Due to various effects of curcumin, such as decreased Beta-amyloid plaques, delayed degradation of neurons, metal-chelation, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and decreased microglia formation, the overall memory in patients with AD has improved.\"\n\nAdd a little turmeric to your meal or drink will not hurt.",
        "I know that this will ruffle  a lot of feathers in the medical -and allied-professions but is it helpful to have terms such as 'Alzheimer's' and 'dementia'?\nThe behavioural symptoms that lead to the diagnosis of the above two have been with us for aeons and are associated with the inevitable  consequences of ageing. Rather like our understanding  of -and coping with- sadness (another inevitable consequence of the  human condition) has coming up with the term 'depression' helped any?",

        "Good for you, but having been the primary caretaker of a mother with dementia, hell, no, I won't go! Regardless of the quality of your doctors and the type of long term care you can afford, there is nothing appealing to me about losing my cognitive function to the extent that I am totally dependent on minimum wage workers to decide when I pee or change my clothes. \n\nRecently, my older sister died of dementia after years in a nursing home. That was her choice. It will not be mine. I had a baseline brain scan does several years ago and follow-up annually with a top neurologist. As soon as I experience the first signs of dementia, I am checking myself out of this Grand Hotel!",
        "Alzheimers....my sister and I are blessed with those genes on both sides of the family.  Grandmothers and aunts have died from Alzheimer's and it was awful to watch the 20 year decline. The future looks bleak for us that we will escape the ravages of the Alzheimer's gene. We try to take care of ourselves, eat healthy, exercise, limit alcohol, but sometimes it feels futile, because there is no \"cure\", no magic pill. Every memory lapse I have, I worry...is this the beginning? I've told my kids...don't let me die like that--my aunts and grandmother and parents didn't want to die like that. They knew what an emotional burden it would be. I'm hoping for better death with dignity solutions.  Thank you Stephen for your story. It hit home.  Wishing you all the best on your journey.",
        "Both my parents have alzheimers. I took care of my mom the last 3 years of her life. My father is in his nineties and I can hear the despair and pain in my stepmother's voice. They have money and he hasn't been taken to a senior facility yet. \n\nShortly before my mother died she experienced the second of what you might call as pure awareness. Unlike the months before she was completely aware of her surroundings and remembered a note she had written down days before when I was with her and she didn't know what day, state, etc...\n\nThis means despite their seeming lack of awareness, inside that brain they are acutely aware but unable to communicate their awareness. This terrifies me more than anything else. \n\nI don't see getting this disease as simply as you do. I see it as a daily horror show. I hope I can figure out a way to end my life as soon as I am diagnosed.  That is my solution.",

I was her caregiver, first at home, then at the nursing home where she spent her last five years, and I visited every day.  Yes, like with the author\u2019s mother, there were moments where she smiled or laughed and seemed to experience simple pleasures, but the majority of her time was filled with utter misery.  If Alzheimer\u2019s ever comes for me, there is no may I could ever try to find peace and acceptance with the diagnosis.  Instead, I would take matters into my own hands to ensure I didn\u2019t spend years in misery the way my grandmother did.",

        "I very much hope that you stave off the progression as long as you can, and that your course is much like your mother\u2019s We found with my father that, while neither Namenda nor Aricept had much impact alone, the combination was a remarkable boon, actually taking him *back* about 5 years in terms of symptoms (as opposed to the promised holding-of-the-line). \n\nAs for me, no thank you. Because it runs in my family, I have prepared everything I need to achieve my own departure via VSED (Voluntary Stopping Eating and Drinking). As a death doula and caretaker of those who\u2019d died of one of the dementias, I have gained whatever experience I\u2019m to have from that and I will not put my family through it in hope that I will have a pleasant run. The alternative to the pleasant run. The alternative is wretched and torturous and the ending certain. \n\nMy preparation for the hastening of my own ending, should it become necessary, has been aided by the Final Exit Network, angels on earth, who believe we should all have the right to self determination. Although our Supreme Court disagrees, VSED is not considered suicide and comfort measures can be provided by most hospice agencies. A day or two of annoyance (thirst, hunger) and then freedom. That\u2019s my plan. I wish you well with yours Mr. Gettinger.",

        "My 3 sisters & I took turns caring for our wonderful mother in her condo for almost 4 years because of dementia. When it became obvious that she needed more care, we found a small retirement center with a decent memory care unit. After she moved there, she never fully understood why she was there. She was often frightened and very anxious even though one of us visited her every day. She would cry when we left and then we would drive home in tears. To see her sitting alone in the dining room in her wheelchair was devastating. Towards the end, the staff had to use a Hoyer lift to get her in & out bed. We let our precious pets die with dignity when their quality of life is gone & when there is zero hope for any improvement. There is a very strong family history of dementia. Our father died of complications as well. We had brain autopsies done for both of our parents for more information regarding the exact cause and to further research for this awful disease. If I do indeed develop dementia, my daughter & family know that I will find a way to end my life with dignity & not rely on the stipulations in my health care power of attorney, the health care system or my doctors. I would never put my family in any situation where they could be criminally liable for my death. I wouldn\u2019t wish this disease on my worst enemy. \ud83d\udc94",

        "My mother had AZ and for most of her final years, she was happy enough.  But what I can never erase from my mind is the final chapters of her life where I would see absolute terror on her face as she no longer knew who she was, who I was or where she was.  Trying to tell her was fruitless and no amount of comforting helped.  Sadly, I saw her death as a blessed release.\nMy brother suffered a similar fate but with a different kind of dementia.",
        "As our mother sank deeper into dementia, we all found temporary levels of comfort. One of the good things is that she never lost her sense of humor, though her short term memory was gone, which meant we could tell her the same jokes over and over again and she'd laugh anew each time.  \n\nHer favorite?\n\nWhy don't lobsters share their food?\n\nBecause they're shellfish! \n\nMake sure you say \"shellfish\" in an exaggerated manner.",
        "I have reached a different conclusion after caring for my mother through Lewy Body Dementia. It was horrible - she suffered greatly and modern medicine had little to offer. She had periods of lucidity which were crushing because she was aware of what was happening to her, and she didn't want to live that way but she was no longer competent and could not end her life. I have also experienced cognitive issues and have chosen to end my life before I progress to an advanced stage. Both patients and their loved ones suffer greatly by having no other option but basically to starve to death slowly. My mother was in diapers for the final two years and literal skin and bones at the end. She required round the clock care at home for more than two years. There was very little joy to be found ever.",

The medical community lost precious years of research and now we have people going into that darkness and we do not know how to help them or to slow the progression .\n\nWe have Mickey Mouse tools in our medical tool kit  we are selling  hope to families  in expensive meds , plenty of happy talk commercials  ,for pay facilities  with unskilled support services if you have money.

        "Just this week FDA iwill be holding a meeting on a new drug from Eli Lilly (Donanemab). Halted progression in a third of Alzheimer\u2019s patients, slowed it in about 50%. So better results than Leqembi (Eisai) approved two years ago. \n\nFDA has been sitting on this for awhile concerned about side effects. Apparently they got burned on approving earlier drugs too quickly and have become overly cautious on this one. \n\nGiven the debilitating nature of this disease, they should just approve it already and let the medical community decide if the benefits outweigh the cost and risks. With so few treatments available, why not try something that studies demonstrate has an improved clinical outcome?",

        "I appreciate Stephen Gettinger\u2019s articles on this disease and wish him the best. Each person should figure out how to approach death and dying.\n\nAs I reach the age when my father started exhibiting signs of Alzheimers that took his life ten years later at 84, I worry whether reduced memory or changing moods brought on by aging are the first symptoms. As it stands today, I think I would take my life a year or two after diagnosis before it was too late. My sister was surprised that my father did not have a stash of pills for this purpose. \n\nFor those who correctly worry about the spouses, it may help to know that some humans will be resilient. We were deeply concerned about our mother. Spouses have a shorter life expectancy than Alzheimer patients. However, after he died she started traveling, formed a relationship with a new boyfriend, and lived another 20 good years before dying at 100. She attended the weddings of grandchildren and welcomed great grandchildren. It is hard to know what is best for any individual.",
        "My father had wonderful care in his last years provided by a devoted, live-in caregiver. I think of him often, and am eternally grateful for the  service he provided.\n\nUpside? In his last five years my father was still in there somewhere, but his pain and shame were heart wrenching, day in and day out. Despite excellent care, there was neither happiness nor dignity in his existence. There were brief periods of calm and serenity, but no clarity, no relief. In the end, his death at 91 was quick and merciful, putting an end to his suffering.\n\nA decade after our father's death, my 70 year-old brother on the autistic spectrum insists that he has Alzheimer's. Thankfully, tests have revealed no abnormal cognitive decline, but the results have not cured his obsession. The trauma of our father's decline remains deep inside of us.\n\nI have a religious mindset, so I like to think that there was some meaning in all this, a big picture that cannot be seen. I am humbled by the mystery, and pray that scientists soon come up with a cure or at least an effective treatment that will allow everyone's final years to be sweeter than my father's.",

For our forgetfulness, which lets us begin anew, we give thanks.

With Alzheimer's for some 15 years, Rosemarie, and I with her, discover the world anew each day. Just as a child delights in each new moment, Rosemarie savors each moment as if it were new.

As a chronically ill person, I'm more than aware of my limitations. Most folks are literally oblivious to theirs. While it might be scary to consider these \"future you\" issues, it's infinitely scarier to live through them when your options are limited because you didn't plan ahead.

No matter the capacity. \nWhether disease, illness, or injury ... there are many nuances to being unwell.  \nEven in the most dire situation,  there can be  many moments of joy .  Too often this simple fact is forgotten. Life doesn't suddenly end with a diagnosis.  \nSeeing as none of us are getting out of here alive, I appreciate the reminder that no matter what cards we are dealt , we can choose to approach our eventual  demise with curiosity , conviction and yes,  bravery .....  if something is inevitable why fight what we cannot change ? \n\nIt's the caregivers who really need the help.   Let's both  fund the research into controlling this cruel disease and at the same time support and fund  the caregivers who are emotionally and physically worn out .",
        "Wow, the comments about ending your life by Fentanyl or running off a cliff wearing socks and clutching a bottle of gin are kind of disturbing. Although, the socks and gin thing sans the falling off a cliff scenario sounds like something me and my college besties might have done. And US, I know, is behind on funding national research at the levels it needs to. But guess who is?  UK, Canada, many EU countries, India, and China. A breakthrough is coming. I feel it. Not a cure maybe but some effective treatments. Instead of the comments about ending it all, how about contacting your State Legislature and your Congress People and President Biden instead. Just advocate for a moon race here. Put your angst to good use and demand your government do more. Day in and day out, in my job, in neuroscience division of a biopharma company, I interact daily with passionate people at Alzheimer's Association and similar organizations. I am not a scientist, but I am in contracting and procurement, and I am noticing that the majority of contracts I am now processing are with world experts in FTD, Alzheimers, and related neurodegenerative diseases.

        "A beautiful article. as so often in life, we do what we can and accept what we must. \n\nBut here is my frustration. Over years of research with atomic force microscopy I am confident that the basic cause of Alzheimer's can be identified and mitigated. There is no mysterious chemistry involved. A normal protein in brain cells called tau accumulates and aggregates spontaneously into long filaments, which in turn assemble into a three-dimensional network which looks (microscopically) and acts exactly like Jell-O. It blocks the flow of both nutrients and waste products, and neurons die. \n\nThe rate at which tau aggregates varies a little with different genetic variants, but the real determinates are incredibly simple: temperature, acidity, and salt concentration. (see link)  Chronic inflammation, which increases all three, vastly accelerates the disease. \n\nSo why didn't our research progress? We were unable to get funding from NIH or AA (no money at the time for researchers without existing grants), and industry and venture capitalists have no interest in basic research because knowledge cannot be patented. The only drugs that are known to slow tau aggregation are methylene blue, lithium, and anti-inflammatories. All are out of patent, so there is no money for human research. \n\nWe only want a cure for Alzheimer's if it will make us rich. That's why we don't have one.",
        "Some random thoughts:\n\nI admire Gettinger's spirit, and to a certain extent I'm inspired by it.   But I've got to agree with the consensus among the posts here that his case is a relatively rare one.  He has an admirable attitude but also a great deal of luck.\n\nAt 71, AZ is something I think about like probably everybody else in my age group.  There've been warning bells.  Getting lost in familiar surroundings, several years ago.  Then nothing until, a couple of years ago, I couldn't remember - ironically enough - how to spell \"thought.\"  I got it after some seconds, but this was still very scary.  I'm leaning toward seeing a neurologist.  I've decided it's better to know the truth in advance.  I think.\n\nI do share the believe of many commenters here that it's better with this disease to get out while the getting is good.  I'm lucky in having the resources to do this.  I'd probably go to some country with laws and a health system that provide for a rational exit.  I know that in our dreadful health system, multitudes of people can't do this.\n\nFinally, I've been lucky about AZ in one other regard - neither my parents nor anyone close to me has had the disease.  My heart goes out to the many people here who've had to take care of  loved ones with the disease.",

They never were late or no-shows. They lovingly cared for Mom, and were her devoted companions. They worked three full days and two part-time days when mom was at adult day health, but we paid them for those two days full salary because I needed them early am and afternoons.  We paid them also for two weeks of vacation every year full salary. After she died, we paid them each two months salary out of gratitude. Those women saved our life really by being so loyal and so reliable. They are in our lives today, family really. This should be mission one for our schools. Work should be well-paid and valued, but we need qualified, caring workers. We have many young adrift and without purpose. If they are not embracing trades, military, or college-bound, they should consider elder care as a desirable path. My Mom also was entitled to free meal delivery, but food so bad, I had to decline it. That too could be a great use of our young; make quality food for our elders. Nutritious, quality food.",

        "This is the fate of most of us. With enough heath care to let people with grave health conditions to linger on and on, by the time people are done with caring for our parents and parent-in-laws, we're between our late-60s and late-70s, dealing with our own end-of-life issues. Couple of my cousins recently buried their 98-year old mother in San Francisco after two decades of ill health. One of the daughters looked at the other one and sighed, \"My, you are old... When did you get so old?\" This was said, of course, by the younger sister. Less than a year after their mother's funeral, both sisters--in their late-70s-- are now in retirement communities in the East Bay.",

They were also my first teachers: history, literature, philosophy etc. etc. \n\nAs a child, I was afraid of them because they were strict disciplinarians - I also looked up to them as my protectors. \n\nDuring her last years, my aunt was afflicted by Alzheimer\u2019s.

As a society, we must do better (but we probably won't.)",

I, an only child, did the very best I could for them both -- I hope and believe what I did do helped, at least a little tiny bit.\n\nI would not for one moment deny anyone their choices. But I am widowed and have no children, nor any living kin I could in any way rely on for help. My friends are wonderful, but after knowing what my mom and I did for Dad, I know I would never have the support Dad had.\n\nShould I ever hear this dreaded diagnosis, I will finalize my playlist (my will and banking already in good order), then drive into a blizzard with a bottle of gin and no socks.",
        "I come from parents who truly believed that the legacy of elder relatives matters.......My Grandmother died when I was  eleven, the other when Mom, the youngest of 6 was a baby. Both Grandfathers  lived with us for a time and I cannot stress how  much  those memories mean to me. We, as a society do not believe in the family value of making sure our elderly live the last chapter of their. lives with love and with dignity.One taught me how to fish at our pond and admired me for feeding our farm pigs alone at age 12. My Italian Grandparent let me , at age 6 watch him and an Aunt make pasta from scratch......He gave us all silver dollars and would sing Italian songs  and rub our backs before bed time.\nGrowing up around these two was a true gift which validated the lessons they still had to teach and the fact that we were to treasure family as a special gift. Only one got Alzheimers and even in his dementia world loving us, protecting us was first for him........We need to decide the values of family and treasure the founders that made it possible....As we all must age, they can still teach us......",

My mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and, although never a fabulous lady, has since become the most unpleasant, nasty human being one could possibly imagine, filled with hatred and disdain for those around her. I\u2019ve been told that this is part of the illness, but I have politely disagreed, each and every time. People who carry no resentment, regret or anger will have no pressure cooker of unconscious emotions that will open and spill over once the filter of the present mind is gone. \nReading about your mother (repeatedly) being delighted at the sight of a flower made me smile and made me realize that a mind at peace has only good things to share with the world, with or without filter, whether affected by Alzheimer\u2019s or not. \nI wish you and your family much happiness and love.",

        "Thank you for writing this. My late Mother was diagnosed at 84 with Dementia/Alzheimers by amazing Dr. Stern at BU Alzheimers. We knew she was in cognitive decline and just needed a definitive answer to what was happening. We got a plan going after. My Mom was light case. Never forgot any of her five kids' names, but she could never be alone. Those last years, we kept her active and engaged. She went to an adult day health program two days a week; we hired two caregivers to cover her remaining weekdays. It was a financial struggle, but we had no choice; we adored her and she deserved our support. My one sibling who could not contribute financially instead would help one Saturday a month. He would pick her up and drive her all over Mass taking her to nature, activities, art museums, and for a nice lunch. He gave me a break, as I was my Mom\u2019s caregiver, but I had a full-time job. Two other siblings took Mom on other weekends. The two caregivers we hired were angels, competent, and loving. Mom never lost her charm, curiosity, humor, kindness, or her deep Catholic faith. We always got her to mass on Sundays.  With US facing an Armageddon, a crisis with so many afflicted and a caregiver burden we are not prepared for, your piece is so needed. Our policymakers must listen to you. Please remain hopeful. I work in Pharma. The world's top researchers are on this. You keep the faith and stay strong. Most of us likely to be diagnosed in the future, so your story will be our story.",

But if you're poor... :/ I spent 6 months in a medicaid nursing home recovering from a brain tumor when I was 31. Horror doesn't even begin to describe it...Filth. There's a good word for the place. Neglect. They were constantly short staffed. Noisy and chaotic at all hours. Food was ...not good at all. Everything came from a can. Every freedom and sense of privacy and personal dignity you take for granted is stripped away. I plan to take myself out if I ever get to that point again and there's no hope of recovery. Honestly, I'd rather be dead. Even if I have no memory or thoughts left, each moment of existence in that place would be chaos and pain. Perhaps more so because I would not have the understanding of what is happening.",

        "I am envious when I hear stories of those who were able to handle their parent's  Alzheimer's calmly - or at least not become emotionally drained. There was no \"seeing the bright side\" in my mother's rapid decline. Her complete behavioral change from a loving, gentle, calm woman to an angry person who lashed out physically at everyone around her (except her grown children) was impossible to deal with and everyone suffered. She spent her last 2 years angry, silent, immobile, and unhappy. There was nothing anyone could do to change that. My only hope is that there will be a cure soon, but I refuse to undergo any tests to find out if I'm next in line, since there is no treatment currently available to ease the symptoms sufficiently.",
        "My mother's emotional cognition held true even as Alzheimer's took her slowly. For years, she was quick to get up and dance to the same songs on a music box in her memory unit. Her smile and accompanying twinkle of the eyes remained heartwarming to many. And her last cogent advice to me before I had to return home to Europe from one of my many trips to be with her was, 'Don't worry. I have my life here and you have yours there with your family. That's how it's supposed to be. I am in good hands and you have to take care of your own family first.' Her saintliness was never once compromised by this debilitating disease. I learned everything about dignity from how she dealt with indignity.",
        "I only wish that I could be as positive as Mr. Gettinger.  My wife's mother died from complications due to Alzheimer's as did her sister, who at the end of her life had forgotten how to swallow.  My wife first began to show symptoms 10 or 12 years ago.  As her disease progressed, her employer kindly nursed her to retirement age.  Covid was something of a blessing in our household because it ment I could work full time from home and look after her and groceries could be picked up without need to enter the store, where she might wander off or need the rest room.  I then recieved permission from my employer to work 1/2 time from home and finally in May of 2022, I was compelled by her further loss of function to retire in order to take on full time care giver duties.  I managed that 24/7 for 16 months, unable to hire any in home help, and finally conceeded that is was no longer safe and she was placed in residential memory care.  In 10 months of care, my 5' 7\" 74yr old wife has lost 2lbs per month and now weights 106lbs.  She entered hospice this week.  She is mostly calm and still recognizes me but has lost nearly all of her words.  Whoever first called this the long slow good bye had it right.  \n\nAs a society we have utterly failed the 6 million familes affected by this illness - prior to Hospice - none of the costs of care are covered by private or federal health care insurance.  In case you were curious, residential memory care costs 6-10K per month and may go on for years.",
        "My Mom died of Alzheimer's and she had so many faculties to the very end. She had a sense of humor always as well as her old cleverness. True, eventually she didn't know my name or who I was, but she still called me \"Dear\" - I was the only one with that name in the family. She gave love and received it until the very end. She was my Mom always, and when she died I lost the one who loved me most. She died in her home (with full time care for 5 years), and arranging her care and frequent visits was the best thing I ever did in my life. A person in a person. Period.",

        "Well, I feel sorry for you and I admire your positive attitude! I couldn't see it that way for myself. Maybe in the beginning but the problem is that we all know how this ends. And I have seen my great-grandmother whom we took care for at home after her second  stroke when I was a teenager. I think this pretty much resembles Alzheimer at a later point. All I can say is I wouldn't want my family and friends carrying that burden. And I don't know what it means for yourself knowing how this is gonna end. So I guess I would try to find a way to escape at an early stage and decide how I end as long as I can.",

Very few Americans are so lucky.\n\nFor dementia sufferers, everyone's experience is different because the disease manifests itself in different ways and follows wildly different trajectories for reasons that are typically immutable and unknowable.  Life delivers cruel ironies in this space, and the only certainty is that the greed of our for-profit, conflicted medical establishment is boundless.  \n\nMy mother swore she would never be institutionalized and begged us to make sure that would never happen, but a serious cardiac condition landed her in assisted living at age 77, and she spent the next six years battling dementia in a memory unit.  Ironically, her confused state was the only reason she could tolerate the enormous indignities that became her daily life.  And maddeningly - after initial predictions that she would live six months \"at most\" - her medical team insisted that they were legally bound to ply her with \"standard\" heart medications to keep her going in her demented state indefinitely ... at $10,000/month.  \n\nDespite a personal health directive that prohibited 'extraordinary life-saving measures,' and despite the fact that her survival depended entirely on the endless force-feeding of modern, whiz-bang cardiac medications, she was condemned to years of suffering while the hedge fund that owned her facility profited nicely ... a fate far worse than death.",

Long forgotten are the grudges she held onto for decades.  Long forgotten are the memories of her violent, alcoholic father and the depression that followed.   Imagined or contrived illnesses are no more.\nMy siblings and I feared her loss of independence long before her diagnosis.

My Dad even had a kind of charisma, drawing others to him without really doing anything at all.   I look at them with admiration at  how they were during that time.

As many people do, she told the doctor what she thought he wanted to hear. I remember sitting behind her and shaking my head: I would not characterize her as a happy person. \n\nThe years ahead displayed the toll of this disease: fears were magnified, losses were relived.  I learned massage the truth when she remarked how she had not seen recently seen beloved family members who had in fact died years earlier. Resentment towards me for her move to memory care was at first intense and visits were truncated.

Her peaceful bedside, filled with laughter, love and no fear of finality, transformed the room, my mood and my life. I thank her and I thank you for your essay.",
        "You hit the jackpot with this. It's quite likely the people who suffer the most from Alzheimers are the patients friends and loved ones. For the patient, in many cases it's not that unpleasant, other than the fact it is a terminal illness and erases perceptions of connections with people in the present.\n\nMake sure the patient is comfortable and cared for, but by all means get  yourself a trusted counselor or friend to help you cope.",
        "Thank you for writing this article. \n\nI see various senile dementia diseases in my and my spouse's families, and watch both of us in our sixties having more memory problems. \n\nYour column isn't Pollyanna, but it is a worthwhile counterpoint to most of the painful, pessimistic articles I read.\n\nIt gives me a different path to focus on.\n\nWhether our lives go as well as could be or as badly as could be, having a focus on good and useful ways to go is a nicer way to live than frantically worrying about bad things that haven't yet happened. \n\nOur lives will be different. But we need not assume it will be horrible. If it turns horrible, we can feel bad then.  In the meantime, we're taking your perspective and advice to heart, and focus on enjoying the present.",
        "I've been taking care of my mother with Alzheimer's full time, and up to a point my father since 2010. So much for watching my parents enjoy their \"Golden Years\" together traveling, attending to their home, etc. She gradually started declining since about 2009 and my sister even reported she felt there was \"something amiss\" as early as 2005. This a long, long decline\n\nI do not suffer depression but I occasionally think about whether or not I should purchase a handgun or have a proven cocktail of lethal drugs handy for one day should I start to experience the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Some kind of exit strategy. I don't have a pension income, don't have kids and am not married. I don't want to burden others either and I don't want to become some sad \"insane\" homeless person, should it happen to come to that.\n\nThe only problem is when to know to end it all? After all, IF Alzheimer's does, in fact, happen, maybe it'll be too far past the line to realize that the action should have been taken earlier and I wouldn't have the means/capacity to do what I was planning?? \nTerrible Catch-22 eh?",
        "Thank you for sharing. My Mom had dementia and sounded a lot like your Mom for which I know we were grateful. She always asked me if I was happy. People place too much store on \"did she still know who you are?\"...to which I'd answer on any given day I might have been her mother, sister or friend but not necessarily daughter. Who cares? I knew the sound of my voice was soothing.\nAs for your diagnosis, I appreciate your candor and attitude. All of us worry about little memory lapses and possible diagnosis of alzheimers but your approach was super helpful.\nThank you again for taking the time to write this.",
        "Beautiful essay.",
        "I watched both of my parents struggle with Parkinson's related dementia. Their final years and months were torment. My physician father attempted suicide twice, once with oxy, the second time with Warfarin - but miscalculated the necessary fatal dosages.\nNow in my mid-60s, I'm well aware of the debilitation that lies ahead, and never want to put my own kids through my own experience of having a father beg them to help him die.\nSo while I'm compos mentis, I'm stocking up on sure fire remedies, easily acquired on the streets of Seattle.",
        "Thank you! Although my mother does not suffer from Alzheimer's, she has developed dementia with symptoms very similar to the ones you described. Unfortunately, the depression did not go away, but continued and made everyday life with her very difficult. Your optimistic words strengthened me. I immediately shared the article with my sisters and although I myself am confused I did not send it my mother! Thank you",
        "While I admire and support your approach to dealing with this disease, I think we need to have a conversation about options for people who don't want to live with Alzheimers to the bitter end. I've watched my mother decline over the last 15 years and I just can't accept that for myself. The thought of losing my mind, my agency, my sense of self and becoming a burden on my loved ones is just too awful. I want to end things on my own terms, and I know from reading the comments on stories like this that there are a lot of people like me. And yet we as a country don't seem to be able to talk about it, let alone create a legal framework to make it possible -- it's taboo, a third rail. I wish that would change.",
        "How fortunate that this author still has the capacity to form cogent thoughts. I am watching a friend struggle with a wife, who at 68, wanders off from him or her caretaker and then a frightening, frantic hunt ensues in big open spaces, like an airport or a large mall. He is \"keeping her home\" for now, but I fear her escaping some night and wandering off and truly getting lost. Memory care facilities may not be perfect, but they will keep a person safe.",
        "A Wonderful foretelling of a life event that offers a refreshing perspective as Demi Moore has recently shared \n\n\"...It's important to just meet them where they're at. And not hold on to what isn't but what is because there's great Beauty and sweetness. And loving and joy out of that....\" such a wonderful solace.",
        "I\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy, but let\u2019s not pretend Alzheimer\u2019s is something it is not. This is a death sentence with no serious treatment available. It robs people of everything that makes them who they are and families of their loved ones who appear only as a shell. It causes financial strain on everyone involved all in a futile exercise of care that does nothing meaningful to change the ultimate outcome. I see no reason for myself to live this way should disaster strike me in the future. We should allow physician assisted suicide for people afflicted with this terrible illness. \n\nUntil then I have faith in the scientists and doctors in this country. One day they\u2019ll have a cure but likely not in my lifetime. Until then, people should be offered a safe option to check out of a life doomed to a cruel mental decay.",
        "Thank you for a very cogent article about a scary subject for us ageing boomers. Your personal insights provide hope for me if I should receive this dark pit of diagnosis.",
        "It's good that you're in a pretty good mood right now and managing your disease through various therapies.  I'm sure you realize that as you decline further, you'll no longer have the capacity to follow these therapeutic workarounds.  And while it's good you're monitoring your mood now, it could change for the worse without your ability to understand why that is or how to rein it in.  Also, you'll spend years in diapers.\n\nBut hey, if you have the resources to live in a facility where someone wipes your butt with dignity, and you're comfortable with your future self, by all means ride the disease all the way down.  My uncle didn't have that choice - my aunt spent the last five years of her life in a care facility.  My uncle is now bankrupt.\n\nI'm not clear on what medical advances with respect to Alzheimer's have been made since your mother's illness.  I've heard of these expensive infusions with iffy results and high risk of serious side effects.  The cure is worse than the disease.",
        "I just read yesterday that Dr Dean Onrush just completed a study with Alzheimer's patients that were put on rigorous diet (whole food plant based no oil, no salt) and lifestyle changes (exercise) who improved after 5 months (compared to the control group).  Not a cure but a way to slow down the progression of the disease.",
        "Excellent story.  Thanks for sharing.  I, too, have a history of Alzheimers in my family and am soon to turn 70.  So far, I don't think I see any of the symptoms but am watching closely (and, at time, thinking I am in denial).\nBut thank you for your story.  It gives folks like me hope.",
        "Watching my mother in law descend into Alzheimer\u2019s over ten years was heartbreaking.  Every day she thought her mother died and she had to pack and get back to her home country. It\nMust have been the most traumatic event of her life and Alzheimer\u2019s made her live it again and again and again.\n\nIf I get it I don\u2019t want to live with it.  She didn\u2019t live, she existed and she suffered and she didn\u2019t enjoy her grandchildren nor her children.",
        "Thanks for your story. My mom had Alzheimer's for a decade and passed a month ago. She had much the same experience as your mother. She lived the last five years in Memory Care. She was content, happy to be able to do what she wanted. She liked her caregivers, and sometimes \"sat in\" on their staff meetings on the floor, as she liked meetings. She was in a similar zen state, living moment to moment, after a busy life working and raising three kids. She was not in pain, happy to be able to make her own choices.  I agree it was probably more difficult for us to watch her fade away, than it was for her. But taking the fear out of this disease is useful to me.",
        "I don\u2019t know how much money is being dedicated to what is looming as the next medical crisis but it is not enough.  Add to that the insurance and pharmaceutical company skims along with the Dickensian care options for seniors.   Maybe we need to start stockpiling pills.   Tell someone else where they are, though.",
        "Thank you for this. I have seen family and friends decline with Alzheimer\u2019s. From my personal experience, the biggest challenge is not with the person whose body is declining, but rather with those around that person. Instead of accepting and working within the new reality, spouses, children and friends fight it. Any chronic disease is challenging. How we deal with it can affect the rest of our lives",
        "I wish the author well, and I hope he gets the best case scenario his mother got (he paints a very rare, optimistic picture). \n\nWhen my mother was diagnosed at 74 she was inspiringly zen. As ALZ took over the next three years, she was in emotional distress a greater and greater amount of the time, hitting 100% in the months before her death. \n\nIf I get diagnosed, I will take no more than a year to get my life in order, make good memories and say my goodbyes, then I will find a way to say the final goodbye while I still can.",
        "Good article.  Mr. Gettinger notes that he and his mother each suffered from lifelong depression.  Is it possible that depression is a risk factor for Alzheimer's?   \n\nThere is no sugar coating it:   Alzheimer's is a dreadful illness for which there is, as yet, little hope.   My younger brother was diagnosed in his late sixties.  It is hard to see a person you love suffer.",
        "This was a wonderful piece of writing. Thank you so much.",
        "Sorry, but even if the patient has a tolerable life, the family may go through living hell to provide it, if the financial ability to provide professional care is unavailable.   \n\nThe spouses taking care of a sufferer for years without help, without a break--what of them?  They are out there."
