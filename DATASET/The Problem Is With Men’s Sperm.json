Even a stopped clock is right sometimes and he was right there. This ignoring of such issues is true for male problems in general, including circumcision, which is something I've never seen any feminist up in arms about.

Imagine a headline that says \u201cwomen\u2019s eggs are the problem\u201d. When the article was actually about how environmental toxins harmed the viability of gametes in women.

OK, it\u2019s hard to argue against investigation in seeking truth, remediation or prevention of dire outcomes. \n\nSpeaking of dire outcomes, remember the \u2018freak out\u2019 when the earth\u2019s population went over 3 billion? All is pretty quiet at 8 so far- cutting off USAID might incur a change in attitude though. I don\u2019t think we will run out of fertile humans soon, minus one global nuclear exchange.\n\nIf this is an American or Western European issue (note: Korea has a very low birthrate for specific reasons), then how is sperm motility in places with less stringent environmental protections? I would start at ship-breaking yards in South Asia for maximum exposure to chemicals and toxic waste. Then, move to other populations to compare. \n\nAll we have to do is wait ~1200 days for the science spigot to be turned back on.",

I speculate it's environmental hazards and the stressful lives people live.",
        "Correcting bias is a bad way to frame a scientific debate. It's not, as you say, going to win hearts in minds. You merely characterize male infertility research as science with an agenda, namely reassigning blame. A goal which Dr. Swan is explicit about wanting to achieve.\n\nIt's more constructive to point out that we can't solve infertility by simply looking at half of the reproductive process. We should look at male infertility because there is a better opportunity to learn. In terms of improving outcomes, a dollar spent on on male infertility is going to accomplish a lot more than an additional dollar spent on female infertility simply because so little research has been done on the subject.\n\nIn terms of narrative, it also doesn't really matter whether men have a biological clock. The age gap between married couples is only about two years. The effective time limit to start reproducing is the same for men as it is for women. Parents (plural) have a biological clock. It's not until you begin pairing 30 year old frozen eggs with 40 year old unfrozen sperm that you begin to see meaningful temporal differences. The female biological clock takes precedence but for all intents and purposes the couple is operating on a unified timeline. You should introduce the story as such. If you're going to bother freezing eggs, you should probably consider freezing sperm as well. Nobody is getting any younger.",
        "Endocrine disrupting chemicals are also a possible contributor to the explosion of trans-identifying children in the US.  Until about 2015, severe gender dysphoria was vanishingly rare, affecting about one person, nearly always an adult male, out of every twenty thousand people.  Today the rate among adolescent girls has risen as high as 5% in some studies.  While social contagion due to social media is the likeliest explanation for this extraordinary increase and change in demographics, it may also be influenced by changes to normal hormonal influences on the brain of developing children caused by synthetic chemicals in our food and environment.  We know from animal studies that adult sexual behavior is strongly influenced by hormones at brief, critical periods of development; disruption of the timing of these events in childhood may have profound effects on adult attractions and desires.",
        "When my ex-wife and I were contemplating having children, we both decided on one child.  So, we are a small cog in the declining birthrate.  My mother had three kids, two girls and a boy, but, this was the Fifties.  We have that one child, who has grown up to be a lovely woman, but cannot have any children due to a medical problem which was corrected by, as she put it, \u201cby removing her plumbing for having a child.\u201d\n\nIn earlier times, the number of kids to have was enough to have \u201can heir and a spare\u201d, and both had to be male.  This helped by giving the best chance to have a male heir when the couple grew old.  Most girl children would officially become part of their husband\u2019s family when they married, destined, if they survived the birth of their children, to take care of his parents when they grew old.\n\nNow, mostly, Republican politicians would decry my ex and my decision.

        "Unhealthy sperm of men because of environmental toxins?\n\nUnless the environment in which humanity lives can be cleaned up it's obvious the argument of nature (genetics) vs. nurture (proper environment, education, etc.) will be entirely won on the nature side of the argument because a toxic environment will force humanity to genetically design itself as carefully as possible to thrive in such an environment.\n\nTypically in society, or at least in the Western world, we hear that nurture or the environment triumphs over nature, or more exactly genetic makeup of people is not as important as people might think, that the proper environment and/or education makes up for genetic differences between people, that all people are relatively equal, but if the environment is so toxic as to affect sperm of men negatively, well then there are two choices: 1) Draconian environmental laws to clean up the world (everything from climate change to plastics) which doesn't seem likely, or 2) A project to go as deeply into human genetics as possible and design a human race which can thrive in a severely compromised environment.\n\nIt really is ironic though that humanity for years has betted on nurture or the environment, especially in form of free societies, education, and so on to give people better lives, to make genetic differences between people unimportant, and the end result has just been the creation of toxic environments requiring genetic design of humanity more than ever.",

So it may be that if we make childbearing a solely intentional undertaking, pursued by people who know what they're getting into, population decline is inevitable.

For the record, briefs have the propensity to hold one's testicles closer to one's body than do boxers, and that small difference in spacing artificially raises the average temperature that one's testicles are exposed to.  I have no hard data on how many tenths of a degree warmer on average that temperature might be, but it can't be very many tenths of a degree. \n\nAfter several months of trying, I went and bought several pairs of boxers.  Shortly thereafter, within a month or two, my wife was pregnant.  (Later that summer, playing league softball with the guys, I was hit in the groin by a batted softball.  As I lay writhing on the ground, one of my teammates came over to check on me and said \"No problem. Your wife is already pregnant.\")\n\nThen I went back to wearing briefs.\n\nThe two later times that my wife expressed her desire for another child, I switched to boxers and promptly impregnated her.  (It could also be that she stopped using birth control, but you never know.)\n\nIn our house, boxers are referred to as \"pregnancy pants.\" \n\nMaybe the MDs would like to comment.",

Numerous historians and other scholars (notably Nancy Langston and Sara Vogel) have amply documented the known risks of EDCs and how federal regulators have chosen to downplay or ignore them.\n\nTo be clear, the etiology and epidemiology of infertility is complex. Evidence pointing to the direct, causal role of EDCs in variety of health problems remains mixed although some conditions, such as obesity, the evidence is getting stronger. \n\nBut so long as regulations in the United States rely upon outdated measures of toxicity and deference to industry, meaningful solutions will remain elusive. It took a series of shocking events to create the consensus around banning certain chemicals such as DDT. (And that has come as a mixed blessing in some instances.) The subtle, complex way EDCs work in bodies and environments suggest that some made-for-TV or made-for-social-media event is unlikely.",
        "My husband and I are now getting fertility help because I'm a cancer survivor (and didn't save eggs before chemo because the cancer was so aggressive, my prognosis was poor and we felt uncomfortable delaying treatment by even a couple weeks). \n\nTurns out we would have ended up at the fertility clinic anyway, because my husband's sperm count is low and quality is poor, though he's only in his early 30s. The cause is unknown, but ultimately his fertility is as diminished as mine, and I've been through 16 rounds of chemotherapy.",
        "When I taught high school years ago, teachers would joke about OSS - old sperm syndrome - which seemed to account for the common behavioral issues in kids that had a very old father (and often a trophy wife). It was anecdotal for sure,  but definitely a very recognizable pattern\u2026 I always wondered why there weren\u2019t more studies done.",
        "We are at least 4 years away from any new, effective environmental regulations. Sorry to be blunt, but that's where we are.",
        "Back in the day, 1968 to be exact, my husband and I, as is now said, hadn't gotten pregnant. We visited my gynecologist and were told I should have a D&C to make sure I was able to produce. So, I had an invasive procedure to check me out and an uncomfortable stay at the hospital. All was deemed to be healthy. Only then was my husband asked to donate sperm for the cause. I imagine his procedure was more fun and certainly less invasive. Low and behold, he had a low sperm count. It was recommended that we adopt if we wanted children. We did - a delightful healthy now fifty-five year old man. Five years later I thought I had the flu. It turned out to be my other healthy and delightful now fifty year old son. \n\nTo quote the comment from InTheWoods,  \"it's (the article) presented from a feminist perspective to show how gender roles and power dynamics shape the issue, which goes unnoticed when it's presented in a neutral way. . . .\nThe problem is that, historically, the only way to get something funded and researched is to link it to a man. So here, in this article, we are told 50% of the time infertility is associated with the man.\" \n\nI have, for over fifty years, resented that it was assumed by my male doctor that I was deficient and should go first.",
        "60-88% of the country is insulin resistant depending on where you get your information. Insulin resistance makes impossible to produce enough hormones because they are made out of fat. The insulin causes hormones and fat soluble vitamins A, K and E to be stored as fat. Vitamin D as well all though that's not a vitamin it's a hormone. No real mystery why people are having less kids and are less fertile. They are in such poor physical condition from all the carbs they can't even reproduce.",
        "The decrease in fertility worldwide is a good thing for the survival of our species and other species as well, if you are among the minority who believe that the world is overpopulated, and that people cause environmental damage and climate change. \n\nI am aware that many believe that population is not the cause of our climate and environmental crises, but this makes no sense to me. And there are those who claim that we can not manage a decrease in population, which also makes no sense. \n\nNew York state, for example, has been managing with a declining population relative to other states for decades. Our population is now relatively stable and predicted to remain at around 20 million in 2100. I believe this gives us a real advantage in addressing the climate crisis over states like Texas, estimated to have a population of around 100 million by 2100, or Florida, predicted to have around 70 million people.",
        "6\nY Chromosome: Decline of the Y chromosome: Are men to go extinct ...\nThe male (Y) chromosome evolved from an ordinary autosome, gaining the SRY gene to trigger male development, which then caused it to diverge from its partner chromosome (which became the X chromosome). This divergence, beginning around 166 million years ago in mammals, was driven by the progressive suppression of genetic recombination between the X and Y, leading to gene loss on the Y and the accumulation of genes essential for male-specific functions, like spermatogenesis. The Y chromosome continues to degenerate and lose genes, though it's uncertain if it will completely disappear. AI",
        "A curious take.  It is standard practice to test both partners in cases of infertility, and for issues with sperm, ICSI is often effective.  That said, the issue regarding endocrine disruptors is that claims have become  made overly broad to include literally 1000\u2019s of compounds, most of which we are never exposed to in any quantity as to be meaningful.  Just another example where politics has interfered with good science.",
        "The bias against women, always assuming that if a couple struggle to conceive it must be her \"fault,\" is problematic in and of itself.  But it also means men are often emotionally unprepared for the news when it's they who have lower fertility.  Liberty Walther Barnes has written about this very sensitively in her book \"Conceiving Masculinity.\"",
        "I'm so old, I remember when RFK Jr. cared about environmental toxins that do bad things like decrease fertility and, according to some studies, also cause autism. But that's not part of the Trump cult's worldview, so we instead we roll back clean air and clear water rules and put the blame where it doesn't belong: life-saving vaccines. It's shocking how much we have lost in just a few short months.",
        "\"The idea that sperm counts and quality have declined over the past 50 years, possibly because of environmental toxins, is not new, and there\u2019s great disagreement about it. But even if the science is unsettled, the warning signs are worth taking seriously.\"\n\nThere is ample evidence that endocrine disrupting chemicals, EDCs, are wreaking havoc on our bodies, developmental abnormalities, obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers - more than enough evidence for any sane society to ban them.\n\nThe phrase \"environmental toxins\" refers to the over 1000 EDC compounds the chemical industry has unleashed upon us, with the blessing of our politicians who are more concerned with protecting commerce and profiteering than protecting public health.",
        "One needs to be careful when quoting researchers who have written a book. That researcher has a financial incentive to spark alarm. Yearly visits to check sperm? Before any screening test is utilized, one has to prove both that it correlates with outcomes and that there is a proven treatment for poor results. I am in the field and neither of these criteria have been established.",
        "Ironic, I suppose, that the current self-described \"pro-natalist\" US regime has zero interest in trying to fix the environment.",
        "Adopting the precautionary approach to chemicals in products would be the single biggest stride forward the country could make for both the environment and human health.  Small wonder no politician is talking about it.",
        "If endocrine disrupting substances and other freaky industrial chemicals in our environment are imperiling human fertility I can only imagine what\u2019s happening in the total biosphere, where mammals, reptiles, insects birds and fishes are in the midst of a mass extinction.  In my view if people stopped having babies all together, the other inhabitants of the planet might stand a chance for survival.  Subsequent generations of humans have not made the planet a better place, they\u2019ve made it exponentially more dangerous and perilous.",
        "The parenthetical statement that people should stop microwaving plastics is something that should be CAPITALIZED not put as an aside. \u2018Microwave in bag\u2019 is something that is on a lot of food items, vegetables included. \u2018Microwave safe\u2019 is another. It is NOT safe for humans (or pets) to eat things microwaved in plastic, yet it is widely done precisely because warning against it comes parenthetically at best.",
        "Making sperm freezing a standard precaution without broad insurance or subsidies would give the wealthy a reproductive safety net that others lack. As environmental factors erode fertility, births would tilt toward the privileged \u2014 a market-driven echo of eugenics. If preservation becomes necessary, it should be as accessible as vaccines, not another perk of wealth.",
        "This is a very important topic. Unfortunately I have several male friends who are unable to have children after trying for many years. In one case my friend is still Young in my opinion he is 40 and he takes a lot of prescription drugs including Propecia. When I pointed out to him another article where Propecia can reduce sperm I up to 90% he said well I\u2019d rather have my hair.",
        "\"Basically, a substance has to be proved safe before it is allowed to be used commercially.\"  Wait, Europe doesn't allow coffee, alcohol, tobacco or barbecue anymore?",
        "Thank you for raising this important issue!  My daughter turns 13 this fall and is obsessed with high end skin care products and make up.  She loves spending her lawn mowing money at Sephora and Ulta.  I follow her around with the Yuka app on my phone, which rates products for how awful they are for your body.  So many of these products that are marketed directly at young people are pretty scary in their chemical make up.  They include endocrine disrupters and possible carcinogens. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating how we consumers are supposed to be navigating this maze of plastics and poisons.  Like having a middle school aged child isn\u2019t hard enough.  Now I get to say, no\u2014 that $25 lip gloss smells nice, but let\u2019s pick out something else.  Thank you again for raising awareness.",
        "I am all for inquiry into what could be an infertility issue.  I'm also strongly supportive of more robust regulations of chemical usage.  However, the report is clear that there is no scientific consensus.  Measuring sperm rates is inexact. Correlations are not causative.  So I would dial back the fear meter for now.",
        "Why does this research have to be presented as a feminist issue- women get blamed most of the time but men may be more responsible.  What does that have to do with the findings of the research?  Can't the data be presented in a neutral way along with a sentence explaining men are contributing to the problem as well.",
        "Interesting variation on the concept of ecological carrying capacity.  As our population grows and creates more environmental contamination, that environmental contamination reduces our fertility thereby slowing population growth.\n\nCan't really say we're the victims here.  We've been spreading and smearing all this stuff everywhere and anywhere we can for at least the past 50 years...",
        "It's amazing that I occasionally still meet young couples today who haven't been able to have a child but who aren't considering that it could have nothing to do with the woman. It could be the man.  Not only does that perpetuate myths and misogyny; it's also just going to keep them from having a baby."
