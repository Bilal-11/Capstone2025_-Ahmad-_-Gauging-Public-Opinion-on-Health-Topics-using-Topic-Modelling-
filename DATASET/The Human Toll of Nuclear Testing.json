The same despicable attitude displayed toward our environment and any flora and fauna that's not human.\nThe United States has a LOT to answer for ... but it never will.

        "I can see Los Alamos by walking to the top of my road and looking west. It seems innocent enough from this distance, but that's a dangerous illusion. \n\nNuclear Watch New Mexico recently released a map documenting levels of plutonium contamination caused by LANL in and around the area, revealing that our groundwater is likely permeated with the stuff (<a href=\"https://searchlightnm.org/the-long-path-of-plutonium-a-new-map-charts-contamination-at-thousands-of-sites-miles-from-los-alamos-national-laboratory\" target=\"_blank\">https://searchlightnm.org/the-long-path-of-plutonium-a-new-map-charts-contamination-at-thousands-of-sites-miles-from-los-alamos-national-laboratory</a>/).

It\u2019s understandable, wanting to feel safe, but it should be clear by now that the way we've been doing things doesn\u2019t work. If we\u2019ve poisoned the water, if we\u2019ve poisoned the air, if we\u2019ve poisoned the earth, if we\u2019ve poisoned our food, then we\u2019ve already lost whatever battles we think we\u2019re fighting, and we're certainly not safe.",

        "The physical power of nuclear weapons is obvious.\nWhat is not so obvious is that nuclear weapons are primarily psychological. They exist not as self-defense, not a MADD, but as fear. The existence of nuclear weapons is based on weakness, not strength.\nThose who give up nuclear weapons show strength, they show that they will not be bullied. This is the opposite of big-power military thinking.\nJapan had already lost the war when the two nuclear weapons were deployed. And yet the frenzy of militarists has somehow persisted.\nBan them completely, and compensate the generations of marginalized people who have suffered.\nTo do so takes courage.",

        "I\u2019m a retired hydrogeologist, and one this testing did was provide a method of dating \u201cyoung\u201d groundwater using tritium enriched from the H-bombs.  Basically if you find tritium above 1TU, you have water less than about 75 years old.  That water was enriched with tritium from H-bomb testing.  Conversely, if the tritium in the water is absent or below detectable range then it took more than 75 for recharge water to get to that location.  Think wellhead protection.  If tritium is present, then your groundwater is potentially at risk from surface/near-surface contamination sources.  Absent, you have more time to deal with the contamination sources (they are a ubiquitous as oxygen in the air).  Just an odd little \u201cbenefit\u201d.  Other methods would be preferred a byproduct of nuclear testing.",

Suspicion that the weather conditions were such that the drift of nuclear radiation went West, and her body at that particular time as a developing young child was altered causing cancer. \nWhen the evidence about lethality is withheld, down-played, or by whatever means ignored, the public is left only with suspicions and suppositions. That allows the nuclear build-up all over the world to continue in the fear that other humans will destroy us. \nIronic that the destroyers will end up destroying themselves by their own actions.",

        "The main problem the Marshall Islanders face is the prospect of a rising Pacific sea level stand leaving their country inundated, in which case I think offer to reside in the US should remain and be no questions asked. There is a proposal for Pacific island nations to maintain governments & cabinets with representation at the UN even if they don\u2019t have territories above water anymore, and that\u2019s the least we owe them. The Castle Bravo shot of 1954, at higher than expected yield and actual cases of acute radiation syndrome due to fallout exposure after faulty weather forecasts, was the real disaster along with the USSR\u2019s \u201cTsar Bomba\u201d test on Novaya Zemlya just before the Partial Test Ban Treaty came into effect.\n\nNot an era to be proud of, nor will resumption of underground tests with nuclear weapons liable to proliferate to Iran be any kind of favorable development in global politics. We\u2019re well aware that a nuclear war cannot be won; all will lose if one is ever fought. As Carnegie Endowment for Peace advocates, the nuclear deterrent needs to give way to a ban on these weapons accompanied by arms control process to limit conventional forces.\n\nBut it\u2019s not good for media to billboard fear of direct biomedical effects of nuclear radiation being suffered 60 or 70 years later by people born after open-air testing stopped. This is very unlikely. Much of my lifetime, radiation has been a ghoul in the public mind while far greater actual risks to health are often ignored.",

        "Only eight nations are known to possess nuclear weapons. They are the U.S., Russia, U.K., China, France, Pakistan, India, North Korea and Israel. Of those nations, only two leaders have threatened to use those hideous weapons.\n\nPutin has threatened to use nuclear weapons as part of his unjust invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Putin sent \"little green men\" (wihtout Russian insignia) into Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine in 2014.  He did not threaten use of nukes then since he claimed those three regions of Ukraine were acting without his assistance.  After openly invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has been emboldened to threaten use of nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea purportedly developed nuclear weapons in 2006. North Korea has always been a regional belligerent making that region of the world unstable.   Kim Jong Un threatened to use nuclear weapons against South Korea and/or the United States in 2022.\n\nDictators who are not held accountable by their nation's people, laws or a national congressional body are dangerous.  Dictators with nuclear weapons are a threat to the world.  \n\nDictators in Russia and North Korea have recently shown they cannot be trusted.  Free nations of the world must collectively tell Putin and Kim Jong Un that using nuclear weapons wil guarantee a MAD attack.  This world position should be debated and adopted at the U.N..  Barring that, the world's people must come together to speak out against dictators and authoritarianism.",
        "Ok, what about the impact of Soviet and Chinese nuclear tests? Also, these were rather chaotic times. Unless the US intended to harm people explicitly, it was just one of many poorly conceived operations with consequences but necessary nonetheless. We live in a ruthless world where our adversaries would be glad to the free world in Chains, and authoritarian strong men who starve their own populations in charge. Of course mistakes were made and glass broken in the protection of a free world. Clearly lessons were learned and these tests moved underground. while it is important to tell the stories of those harmed, let's not make this an over-simplified, over-reductionist, America-bad-guy story, or one where Russia / China did not exist, nor the associated threat.",
        "Reading this article makes me think of Vasily Arkhipov, the Soviet naval officer who single-handedly countermanded the decision of a trigger-happy submarine captain to attack US naval forces with a nuclear weapon during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nThe Soviet submarine was being pursued by US Navy surface ships near Cuba. The sub had lost contact with Moscow, was evading depth charges, and was stiflingly hot because its air conditioning had failed, so its crew was highly agitated and unsure whether war had already broken out.  Under Soviet naval doctrine, the submarine captain was authorized to launch its nuclear-armed torpedo provided that the sub's political officer concurred---and in this incident, both men agreed to do exactly that. Normally, that would have been all that was required to initiate the nuclear attack. But in a stroke of luck that forever changed history, Arkhipov was also on board the submarine, and due to his rank, he also had to agree to the launch. He refused and managed to talk down the sub's furious captain, thereby preventing a nuclear attack that would have probably led to a global nuclear war.\n\nI think of this incident whenever I hear someone claim that nuclear war can't happen because of mutually assured destruction. Two men, reacting impulsively and with limited information in a high-stress situation, came within a hair's width of starting one.",

They're just too big and destructive. \n\nNowadays, if I understand correctly, the nuclear weapons of the US and Russia are under 1 megaton, many way less than 1 megaton.\n\nBesides being too destructive, the big bombs aren't necessary  (to take out your enemies' underground ICBMs, for instance) as the accuracy of everyones'  ICBM guidance and reentry systems have greatly improved since the '50s.\n\nSo, if testing does resume, the huge nukes tested by the US in the south Pacific (and the USSR in Asia) hopefully are our past collective human shame, not our future.\n\nDon't get me wrong: these things don't belong on the planet.

Above ground tests should certainly be banned including sub critical tests but there is little need to eliminate sub critical below ground tests. Such tests are necessary to determine the stability of weapons, the effect of aging on them, etc.  The US does not just dispose of nuclear weapons when they age. The nuclear fuel and other parts are often recycled into the next generation of weapons. In addition due to the lifespan of the nuclear weapons we have lost much of our old knowledge in regard to constructing them. In at least one case no one knows exactly what chemical was used and how it was manufactured. It was a foam or plastic used for suspending nuclear cores. It was highly classified, apparently to the degree that no existing records detail the exact composition or manufacturing methods. This is exactly the sort of thing sub critical testing is needed to address. Without such testing its likely that mistakes such as the one in Castle Bravo will be repeated. In that case no one was aware that both of 2 different isomers of lithium would act as fuel in a nuclear weapon. Calculations had suggested only one of the 2 forms would react. The result was a weapon far stronger then intended. That is why the Marshall Islands were contaminated and the Japanese fishing boat was exposed.",

        "\u201c\u201dThe detonation of atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in  1945 resulted in horrific casualties and devastation. The long-term effects of radiation exposure also increased cancer rates in the survivors. But public perception of the rates of cancer and birth defects among survivors and their children is in fact greatly exaggerated when compared to the reality revealed by comprehensive follow-up studies. The reasons for this mismatch and its implications are discussed in a Perspectives review of the Hiroshima/Nagasaki survivor studies published in the August issue of the journal GENETICS, a publication of the Genetics Society of America.\n\n\"Most people, including many scientists, are under the impression that the survivors faced debilitating health effects and very high rates of cancer, and that their children had high rates of genetic disease,\" says Bertrand Jordan, an author and a molecular biologist at  Aix-Marseille Universite in France. \"There's an enormous gap between that belief and what has actually been found by researchers.\"\n\nThe studies have clearly demonstrated that radiation exposure increases cancer risk, but also show that the average lifespan of survivors was reduced by only a few months compared to those not exposed to radiation. No health effects of any sort have so far been detected in children of the survivors.\u201d\u201d\n\nIn these two cites that were DIRECTLY BOMBED, the rate of cancers was 10% higher\u2014-90% of cancers were not related.",

Even worse the government has never acknowledged the extent of the harm done or adequately compensated the people directly affected. \n\nThe Trinity test alone spread fallout to 46 of the 48 states in the continental US. And Trinity was much less powerful than some that were detonated after.  Every living thing that was alive in the US during those above ground detonations still has detectable remnants of those tests inside them.",

Many of the impoverished communities in the Four Corners were found to have used mining equipment, wood, and even uranium-bearing stone in home and building construction starting in the 1950s and 60s. BIA and Interior have rebuffed calls for compensation, and downwinder funding was limited to only those who worked in mines in the region. \n\nIn Nevada, there are clusters of interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, and associated intestinal cancers in younger populations with no downwind exposure. One of the speakers from Reno mentioned that DOE contractors continue to block access to state inspectors at uranium mines and former military installations where weapons-grade uranium and plutonium were mined or refined. \n\nThis says nothing of our complete abandonment of the Marshallese, who we dusted with radioactive fallout for 16 years (1946-1962).

I don't think that much radiation and other debris spewed into the air did nothing to our health.\n\nFor the tragic human guinea pigs, the article details studies and the resulting diseases. What about the people who were not close to the site? I remember when the world was following the cloud from Chernobyl and wondering about its effects. How about 2000 clouds?",
        "The article notes that the major powers signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996.  But it doesn\u2019t also state that the US has not ratified the Treaty, so it is not in force.  That seems like a pretty big oversight to me, or did I just miss it?",
        "The quote in a video about not knowing the history and why that matters:\n\nThe biggest hurdles I have in my business that has the tagline, \"If we don't know the history, we can't solve the problem,\" is that too many don't really want to solve problems (although checking a box or pretending to seems to have appeal) and few ever consider history as a tool for change.\n\nThe articles in the series clearly show that the goal is not really to solve the problems created and the goal is absolutely to marginalize the history and the people it represents when it comes to telling the story of nations.\n\nEspecially because so few today have memories of the Cold War era--too young--I used to show my college students parts of, \"The Atomic Caf\u00e9,\" as it sure shows the absurdity and the horrors of what the US, in particular, did. But it's worth noting that many have no recollection of 9/11, let alone nuclear testing, and sooner or later they will hold office and be \"in charge.\" With all the history haters out there, the danger is obvious.",

Our best reply is is not to bluster in kind, but to modernize our nuclear weaponry - which requires actual testing to make sure that it actually works.\n\nThere are terrible ways and there are better ways to test nuclear weapons.  This article focuses on terrible ways from the past.  \n\nKinda like focusing on lobotomies to discredit modern psychiatry - or the marked dangers of the first planes to discredit modern passenger airlines.  Many procedures of the past - in many fields - have been improved over time.\n\nUnderground testing is a much better way of nuclear testing than earlier open-air testing.\n\nI am all for careful limited underground testing of nuclear weaponry.

        "In the 50\u2019s I remember taking 4 cents to school to buy two containers of milk for the afternoon milk break then spending the rest of the day using scissors handles shaping the thin aluminum top in the empty inkwell on my desk. \n\nAt the same time we were hiding under our desks (duck and cover) from Russian atom bombs, a radioactive isotope named Strontium 90 was being discovered in our bone marrow resulting from fallout from nuclear testing that landed on the grass that the cows ate and was transferred to the milk we drank. Mine was the first American generation so gifted by the \u201cprogress\u201d of atomic weaponry. \n\nI guess you could say, we got more than our 4 cents worth.",
        "Nuclear deterrence is what has prevented major conflicts from arising for eighty years. It's not intuitive to think that nuclear weapons have likely saved lives so far, but it is the truth. I understand why we shy away from acknowledging the success of deterrence; it causes us to recognize that nukes underpin our international order, but it's important we fully examine the role nuclear weapons play in maintaining the most peaceful era of the world.",

That first map that showed the red circles for testing spots was very poignant. What are we doing to people? Poisoning them for the sake of testing bombs to poison and destroy more? We need to push for nuclear disarmament. Is there anyone besides nuclear wonks out there pushing for disarmament? Any elected officials?",
        "Interesting article that shows just how ignorant people were about open air nuclear testing.  \n\nThe following link is an article about Operation Starfish which was a US sub space detonation in 1962 that created an electromagnetic pulse that fried the Hawaiian Island's electrical grid 1,000 miles away: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/going-nuclear-over-the-pacific-24428997\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/going-nuclear-over-the-pacific-24428997</a>/.\n\nI find two things very scary about this event: 1) there were strong worldwide protests against it and we did it anyway  2) we and Russia are once again thinking of putting nukes in space.\n\nIt seems as though human memory of destructive events fades dramatically after three or four generations.  \n\nThat is the scariest aspect of all this war mongering talk that is so prevalent from the Republican politicians and their low information leaders and voters.",

        "My father, classified as an atomic vet due to his exposure to an atomic bomb test during the Korean War, passed away due to pancreatic cancer. During the test, dubbed Operation Tumbler-Snapper, he had the protection of a foxhole, unlike the poor sailors and civilians in Bikini Atoll. He felt the heat of the blast on his back, where he  incidentally later developed melanoma. Afterwards, the US Military had my father and other soldiers examine the blast site\u2014all of this with reassurances of their safety. On the horizon, the fallout of this test and others to come drifted into his much-loved home state of Utah to destroy the health of children there. \n\nThe government vivisected its soldiers, citizens, and Nature with these tests. The reckless and dishonest approach to nuclear testing ruined countless lives and should not be resumed.",

It can be interpreted as either massively arrogant or else rhetorically as an intentional understatement to make a compassionate point.\n\nSince Mr. Eisenbud had a distinguished career as a caring environmentalist, teacher, author and administrator, I believe it's the latter.\n\nHowever, lacking context in the article, many readers will likely interpret the quotation the wrong way.\n\nMr. Hennigan, any chance on a compassionate revision to your text?",

        "Despite claims offered by the rulers, a political philosopher said nukes are ethically illegitimate since their use entails harming innocents.\nThe article supports this view while also showing that, in actuality, government violates justice.\nThe partisans of government are, in reality, servants of injustice. When claiming otherwise, it's disinformation.\nSome may think nukes could be used to fight comets or asteroids, but nobody is following Neil deGrasse Tyson around carrying a nuclear football.",
        "I was part of the Mothers Day Action at the Nevada Test Site in 1985 and 1986. We were invited to participate by the Western Shoshone Nation, whose land was being used for the tests. Actions like these and many others during the 1980 and 1990s around the world were key to ending nuclear testing. Must we start again?",
        "The op-ed piece could use a bit of context.  It suggests nuclear weapons were developed solely because  \"rich, powerful\" nations were enamored with them.  The fact that nuclear weapons were being developed by the \"rich, powerful\" nations that were responsible for fighting and ending two world wars that killed roughly 115 Million combatants and civilians seems to have been left out of the analysis. If nothing else, a major take-away of the two world wars was that an ambitious and malignant state actor, unchecked, is capable of initiating global slaughter.  Not creating a deterrent nuclear capability was not a credible option.\n\nWhile I sympathize with those affected by nuclear testing, the second world war's toll on the Marshall Islands was far more devastating than the nuclear testing conducted there.  The \"south sea mandate\" (which includes the Marshall Islands) lost 44.88% of its pre-war population in WWII, and US armed forces lost 611 Killed and 2,341 wounded liberating the Islands from the Japanese. How much sacrifice is it reasonable to ask to prevent a like outcome in a future conflict? \n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to stuff the nuclear genie back into the bottle.  \"Rich, powerful\" nations will continue to try to limit weapons testing and prevent the proliferation through diplomatic negotiation.  Absent a negotiated solution, however,  the only credible tool at hand is deterrence - which requires a working nuclear arsenal, which requires some level of testing.",
        "The comments are sharing the same fantasies we've seen since WW2. The weapons are not going to disappear. Peace will not break out all over the world. As has always been true, and will remain true, it is human beings that will have to navigate the polarity between enough military preparation to discourage our enemies from an action by instilling fear of the consequences verses reckless actions that provoke the enemy into an action they wouldn't otherwise engage in.",

These are both skills that should be taught in our schools and should be especially important for anyone who tries to become a leader.",

        "Carole Gallagher's book of photojournalism, American Ground Zero, published in 1993, documents the effects of above-ground nuclear testing in the United States.

        "I think two things can be true:\n\n1) We should continue to decommission nuclear weapons. There is no need for as many nuclear weapons as we have.\n\n2) We should still have some.

        "Nuclear deterrence is the only thing that has prevented war between the superpowers for the past eighty years.  Nuclear deterrence requires confidence on the part of all superpowers in the effectiveness of each other's nuclear arsenals.  Such confidence may or may not require underground testing.  But if it does, let us have underground testing rather than war.",
