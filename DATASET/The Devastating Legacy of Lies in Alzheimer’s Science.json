        "It is beyond criminal how Alzheimer's research has been hijacked and funding diverted to dead ends.",
        "My husband did not have a chance against Alzheimer's due to the ego-driven quest for scientific stature of prominent scientists who blocked research into hypotheses other than amyloid. Now we know that their research was also fraudulent. Status has been at least as important as money.\n\nAs prominent science writer Sharon Begley documented in 2019 a \"cabal\" of scientist \"believers in the dominant hypothesis suppressed research on alternative ideas: They influenced what studies got published in top journals, which scientists got funded, who got tenure, and who got speaking slots at reputation-buffing scientific conferences.\"\n\n If the amyloid hypotheses were found to be flawed, their careers were terminal. \n\n<a href=\"https://statnews.com/2019/06/25/alzheimers-cabal-thwarted-progress-toward-cure\" target=\"_blank\">https://statnews.com/2019/06/25/alzheimers-cabal-thwarted-progress-toward-cure</a>/\n\nNow the cabal, buoyed by Alzheimer's Association, seeks to make the burden of amyloid, not cognitive function, the definition of the disease. I stopped donating to them years ago because of their propping up amyloid research to the exclusion of any other.",
        "Yet another sad example of the rot that has infected our higher education system from top to bottom. Perhaps it is time to rip the entire system out by the roots and start over. And as the article notes, while the current administration has demonstrated extensive incompetence in the past, it can cause a lot of headaches if it wishes. Better for research and academia to begin cleaning its own house instead.",
        "One problem is that it is almost impossible to (in most fields of science) to publish a failure to replicate. They are just not considered a creative contribution to science. Part of the reason is that a failure to replicate may just mean that the follow up study was done poorly. But it can also mean the original study was done poorly or even dishonestly. In most fields any attempt to replicate is at most, and just barely, considered acceptable for a Masters Thesis, but, as I said, not for publication. It is hard to get research validated or invalidated when the mechanisms for that fall entirely ouside the normal activities and reward structures of the field.",
        "As an AD researcher, I find this piece misleading probably to promote his book.  \n\nScience is self-correcting.  Many of these dubious paper were cited so much was because other labs were able to replicate the results.\n\nThere are some very strong evidence for the amyloid hypothesis and also against it like all theories.  \n\nScientific misconduct is present in all fields and to single out AD is dubious.\nIf other labs cannot reproduce published data it does not gain traction.  So to place the lack of cures on  very small % of scientific misconduct oppose to the complexity of memory formation and human cognition is just sensationalism.\n.",
        "Another perverse incentive: universities compete for top research rankings. But that\u2019s measured by input\u2014 federal grants\u2014 rather than actual scholarly output.",
        "This is so unacceptable! I have witnessed decades of endless promises of treatments and seen first hand each exposed as ineffective! My father was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s in 1983. I was 24 years old and had not heard of the disease until then. My father retired at 59 - months after being diagnosed. He was treated at MGH in Boston for the next several years- eventually ended up in an Alzheimer\u2019s unit of a nursing facility north of Boston where he died in 1997. It was a slow tortuous disease to witness. \nIn 2012 my brother was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 59. He was treated in Vermont where he lived most of his adult life. He died in a nursing facility in Rutland in 2022 at age 70. Another brother has just been diagnosed this year- he lives in Arlington VA where he has lived most of his adult life, he is 75 years old.  A sister who lives close to me in Massachusetts has very worrisome short term memory loss but no diagnosis as yet. \nSince I am one of 9 children born to the same parents - I and others worry about our own futures and whether or not we will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  I am now 66 years old and I see nothing new in terms of effective treatment in all this time!\nHow can that be possible?",
        "Going back to a time when advertising drugs was outlawed would help provide more money for research and development and possible care. Watching numerous commercials for drugs does not help research, only the drug manufacturers.  The ads also  place  inappropriate stress on providers to prescribe drugs with dubious benefits. We need funds for families and caregivers of this disease.",
        "I have to confess that I don't find this article very convincing. \n\nIt's one thing to falsify blots and graphs, we agree on that point. But it's another to dismiss the role of beta-amyloid accumulation in AD. That was one of the first discoveries by Alzheimer himself, after whom the disease was named, and he and his immediate predecessors didn't highlight this out of a desire for money or publications. In fact, scientists now think that the beta-amyloid accumulation might not be the cause of AD, but could be an indicator of an auto-immune response or fighting off an infection. So it's still useful, even if it is now not necessarily a cause but a sentinel. \n\nWe don't have answers because AD is a complex disease. We didn't have answers to cancer for a long time, and still don't. That's the nature of trying to cure diseases.",
        "There is greed in every profession; thanks for addressing this one. Add to the mix the agony, frustration, conflict, and confusion within families making decisions about prescriptive drugs for their dementia members knowing the lack of efficacy, presence of risk, expense, and dubious validity of research.",
        "The problems stem from the structure and organizational culture of biomedical research.  For example, the proliferation of journals, and the incentives to publish as much as possible, means that there are too many scientific papers to be reviewed with any thoroughness.  Moreover, reviewers do not receive credit for excellent reviews.  As another example, Scientists are incentivized to generate as much revenue as possible through lassoing donors and building \"mega labs\" that contribute to institutional overhead funding.  Put scientists on periodically reviewed fixed salaries, limit the size of labs, limit the number of papers that a scientist can publish annually (one or two real contributions is quite outstanding), and implement other reforms and problems of fraud and carelessness will be significantly reduced.",
        "Perhaps mention the power of AI, which is helping to identify fraud with an unheralded efficiency.",
        "As somebody who has participated in both marketing and market research for various Alzheimer's drugs over the past 25 years, I have long believed existing drugs to being of limited to no utility. \n\nI will add to that the fact that very little data supports the amyloid/tau hypothesis, and even the newest drugs only slow their deposition while creating risks of brain bleeds and other dire effects. \n\nThe issue in the scientific community is one of \"sunk costs\", both in money and intellectual capital. I will draw the parallel to the use of HDL as a risk factor in the Framingham study as far back as the early 1980s. Note that today, ALL effective drugs for cholesterol impact LDL and triglycerides, the \"bad\" lipoproteins and cholesterols. Drug so raise \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) go back to that time, but few drugs have been developed, none terribly effective from a cardiovascular risk perspective. The last class of drugs to be developed to raise good cholesterol, the CETP inhibitors, all failed to show benefit in trials. \n\nSo just like HDL may be an interesting marker for cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, amyloid and tau may be interesting markers for Alzheimer's Disease risk and progression. But may be abject failures as treatment targets.",
        "Sad to read at a time when science and scientists are about to be bashed and battered by those in charge.",
        "meanwhile, there are dozens of avenues of research that have gone unfunded, so unresearched, because of the scarcity of grant money available and it all being gobbled up by these charlatans.",
        "Tip of the iceberg:\nThere is a well documented replication crisis in science, especially social \"science\".\nPerhaps the NYT can cover this in more depth since it affects all of us, regardless of our identity groupings.\nBelieve the Science! is only true if the science is believable.",
        "Putting a scientist who cheats on a \"do not hire, fund or publish ever again\" list might do wonders to discourage the ethically challenged.",
        "My father died of Alzheimer's at the age of 88. His decline took some years, accelerating at the very end. I have no doubt that he truly had Alzheimer's because of the arc of his disease progression. I have had a few older relatives on Dad's side of the family who died with some type of severe dementia. So I am deeply concerned for my own fate, and the possible cost to my family. Thus far I am extremely disappointed by the limited understanding we have gained about how Alzheimer's works and how to stop the progression of the disease. This article does not surprise me. I wish I knew what to do and had some influence over what will be done. As it is I am just trying to live my aging years to the max. There are no other options.",
        "But we should trust the science",
        "Researcher Matt Camden just looked at 24 brains.  On average 0.5% of the weight was microplastics.  The brains that came from people who had Alzheimers had ten times more.  \n\nPlease do an article on this research.  Although it needs to be replicated in a bigger study, so he is not claiming causality yet, it\u2019s pretty obvious there is a correlation.",

        "My beloved husband had dementia for 17 years. It ultimately was thought be a mix of Lewy body, Alzheimer\u2019s, and vascular dementias. I share the author\u2019s frustration with researchers\u2019 focus on the amyloid hypothesis and his concern about the falsification of research findings. However, I find the author\u2019s description of persons who have dementia to be disturbing.  Although the disease does steal cherished memories, to declare that it steals \u201cthe very identify that makes each of us human\u201d is both incorrect and dangerous. The Nazis labeled persons who had dementia \u201cnonhumans.\u201d Then they hid behind the word \u201ceuthanasia\u201d to kill them.

        "I work with dementia patients in NYC. Unfortunately, fraud is the least of our problems. As this author has written elsewhere, the biggest problem is the NIH-NIA insistence that amyloid research is all that gets funding. And this has gone on for 20 some years now. To quote another would be whistle blowing researcher, Prof Karl Herrup, \"If you're not studying amyloid, you're not studying Alzheimer\u2019s.\" This scientific myopia has led us to where we find ourselves today.",

        "This essay isn\u2019t going to age well. Check back after AHEAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ3 report their findings.",
        "The essay states that Alzheimer's afflicts about one in nine people over the age of 65. I'm wondering about the accuracy of that figure. There are various causes (e.g. strokes, certain medications) for symptoms that can mimic Alzheimer's. I had an elderly relative who experienced confusion when she was in her 80's and was given only the most cursory of evaluations for Alzheimer's--a verbal test asking the patient to give the date, remember a phrase spoken by the doctor, name animals beginning with a certain letter, etc. On that basis alone my relative's GP decided that she had Alzheimer's. (There was no family history of Alzheimer's.) I'm wondering how many doctors jump to an Alzheimer's diagnosis when presented with an elderly patient who exhibits symptoms of confusion and memory difficulties. If this is a common occurrence it could be complicating matters by underplaying the need to research other causes of dementia and making it difficult to accurately assess the efficacy of Alzheimer's treatments.",
        "I am quite concerned about journalists who are discussing science in such simplistic ways as to be false. There is no doubt that protein aggregation - the process that forms amyloids- plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. To  identify causality, it helps to turn to genetics. There are families, in which early onset Alzheimer's is inherited because these individuals carry mutations primarily in three genes. These genes are either the gene that encodes the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) or they are involved in processing APP into amyloid beta (A\u03b2). I would also like to note that Alzheimers is not the only 'amyloid' disease - there are several diseases that are caused by other aggregating proteins. \n\nOf course, there is no doubt that life style and inflammation contribute, in particular to late onset Alzheimer's. One well-known gene that influences late Alzheimer\u2019s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. However, APOE risk variants only increase risk, they are not causative.\n\nWhy are current drugs not working? One reason is simply diagnostics - we diagnose the disease too late. When symptoms appear, much damage has already been done. Second, it may not be the aggregates that cause damage but their early intermediates. Third, as a disease of the old, Alzheimer's is heterogenous, a consequence of different factors encountered during life.",
        "I have been researching memory and disorders, including Alzheimer's for 30 years.\u00a0\nThe article is spot on. What can we do to fix\u00a0this? \nCap the amount of funding to any single lab!! It's that simple. How?\n\nNo scientist can carefully supervise the work of more than 10 people. A lot of research money to a single lab means too many people in the lab and the lead scientist can't check the details\u00a0of work done by their lab members. Errors creep in and nobody has the time to check them.\n\nScientists with huge amount of funding feel the pressure to keep producing new results to get more money. so their lab members are rewarded to be fast\u00a0but careless.\n\nThis how a handful of scientists dominate the discourse and kill off any fresh ideas. Journalists want to interview only the most famous scientists from the most famous universities. So, new ideas have zero chance of getting funded.\n\nWe do need fresh, out of the box ideas because the old ideas of A-beta or Tau have not worked. But, the proponents of these ideas have huge labs and they sit on all NIH funding panels, so they kill fresh ideas.\n\nCapping the maximum funding to any lab will not only remove careless errors but leave enough money for fresh ideas to flourish and then we will cure Alzheimer's.\n\nFull disclosure --for the past ten years, I have made numerous attempts to get funding for a new method of curing Alzheimer's, without any side effects. Every proposal was triaged.",
        "Excellent analysis. The role of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in influencing research priorities is worth examining as well. Many of its leaders are on FDA advisory committees which include a very large component of pharmaceutical industry leaders.  \n\nThe role of such \u2018charities\u2019 in medical research is extensive. (See also the American Lung Assoc, Heart Assoc, Cancer, etc.) Their close relationships to the drug industry and to government regulators and lobbyists have a powerful impact on how research dollars get spent and whose university gets the largesse to build gleaming new research facilities. \n\nThese charities may have begun as truly grass roots efforts to address major medical issues, but many have grown into giant enterprises led by highly compensated CEOs and are funded and organized so as to groom and/or lobby donors for research funds that may well pad profits while making little scientific progress. (See Anne Paddock\u2019s blog analyzing nonprofits\u2019 tax returns for specifics on some of these.)\n\nI believe the misconduct is worse in dementia research than in some other medical contexts partly because of the stigma and fear of the disease(s), which has been so successfully stoked by the Alz Assoc and its enablers. Helping people diagnosed with dementia by engaging with them directly would undermine this strategy. Meanwhile, Lilly is running teaser ads dropping hints that amyloid plaques are causing AD and hope is on the horizon.",
        "While the author is certainly correct in his criticisms of faulty scientific priorities and a flawed peer review system, we also need to take a critical view toward his approach as well.  He is promoting a forthcoming book and obviously wants to sell as many copies as possible, so naturally here he features all the worst cases.  Taken out of context, these may give lay readers the impression that the situation is far worse than it actually is, and that the system is irredeemably corrupt.  In the current political context, the unintended consequence will be to strengthen demands for drastic cuts in research funding rather than the judicious reforms advocated by the author.",
        "Thank you for the article. I just read something similar in The Atlantic about research conducted by professors at leading business schools. Maybe those who are skeptical about \"science\" have something: scientists are human, and they functions according to the system of rewards and punishments in the environment in which they operate. Healthy skepticism is not denial, but a needed buffer in evaluating claims and alleged breakthroughs.",
        "This is a remarkable overview of a problem plaguing basic brain research and preclinical research.  Blots are, in a few words, easy to manipulate and fake, and peer reviewers rarely find the errors.  Further, when errors are found many journal are reluctant to retract, especially if the authors are powerful academics.  There should be no excuse for senior authors who do not confirm data in a paper, no matter how powerful they are.  Perhaps a bigger scandal is how poorly the NIH and NIMH have guided basic research in this area.  Animal models are not predictive of human efficacy, and in papers and biotech, we still see numerous proposals based on some variant of the amyloid hypothesis.  Patients deserve an innovative, science driven NIH, not an organization doing the same, unproductive research for decades because the reviewers are all amyloid believers.",
        "There are also lies in the history of cancer research.  Based on a history of successful results, William Coley experimented with immunotherapy for cancer treatment in the late 19th  and early 20th centuries.  Coley had some success treating cancer patients with immunotherapy and was a good scientist, conducting his own research. \n\nUnfortunately, James Ewing was Coley's boss and together with the emergence of radiation as the preferred (and most profitable) treatment (and later the FDA), Coley's treatments were suppressed into non-existence. \n\nIt would be many years, but James Allison revitalized immunotherapy and won the Nobel prize for what is considered the future of  cancer treatment.\n\nAlthough his treatments had risks, cancer treatment would have progressed a great deal if Coley's treatments hadn't been suppressed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",

        "I am a neuroscientist with more than 30 years of research experience. Several observations should make any research scientist cautious about the amyloid hypothesis. Examine the foundational report of Dr. Alzheimer; one finds that the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (P&T) were observed in a female subject who is far too young to have had the common form of AD involving 95% of patients. Consider the Swedish identical twin study that shows one twin with cognitive disorder as well as P&T, whereas the sibling twin even twenty years later has neither; clearly environmental factors play a decisive role in disease progression.  Multiple clinical studies agree P&T is not correlated with cognitive decline in AD. Compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis is absent despite decades of research.  In my view it is long past time to move on.",

I worked for decades in research, in academic, national-lab and industrial settings (all non-medical).  \n\nIt would be helpful to clarify what is meant by \"image manipulation\", since I would strongly dispute that all manipulations of images are fraudulent.  Is it fraud to adjust the contrast and brightness of an image?  These are standard operations in imaging of virtually any kind, so surely the answer to that is no.  However, if it's done with the intent of obscuring some \"inconvenient\" information, it could indeed be fraudulent.  \n\n\"Manipulating\" an image is often done merely to make the important information more visible to the reader of a paper.  And why not?  It's actually an important part of a microscopist's trade.  \n\nImages are remarkably powerful at generating ideas.  But even selecting what images to include in an article is inherently subjective.   \n\nSo it's really important to understand this limitation, and use other techniques to supplement and confirm the ideas arising from imaging observations.  Once you've formulated a hypothesis from qualitative observations made from imaging, can you make some less subjective measurement, say via a clinical study?  That extra work is essential, and if the result doesn't support the hypothesis then maybe it's time to retire or modify the hypothesis.  \n\nBut before simply condemning all \"manipulation\" of images, it's important to define what is meant by that, and when it qualifies as fraudulent.",

        "Retired neuroscientist here-- one who started out studying a similar problem: neurochemistry of amnesia (I moved on after deciding that the hypothesis driving my research was incorrect). I think that there are two key issues that drive this misconduct. First, there are way too many investigators like Dr. Masliah with 800 hundred or so publications. That can't be done without delegating work to the extent that the PI can't pay close attention to what is going on in their lab and without putting pressure on colleagues to push the limits of conducting rigorous studies. Second, very few studies are conducted in a way that allows hypotheses to be falsified. This is a key aspect of the scientific method that allows our understanding of the science to advance. Thus study after study has been conducted without substantially changing the underlying amyloid hypothesis.

I am not sure how much influence the \"doctored images\" which seems to be the focus of this column have had on keeping the Amyloid hypothesis in place. \n\nThe problem is that no one has come up with a credible alternative hypothesis that everyone can get behind. Some problems are harder than others to solve. Let us hope that science and scientists will find a way to make progress. We need it, desperately. Let us not get political posturing and ideological warfare to destroy the credibility of the scientific enterprise.",

        "Not being a neuroscientist I cannot do more than inquire, perhaps overly naively,  why the author appears to place such emphasis upon \"doctored photographs\" in his critiques. \n\nAdmittedly a photo is worth a thousand words, but surely there is more than the presentation of photos when it comes to Alzheimer research (or other brain maladies)...I can see where they would play some demonstrative role, but is there not much more to this area of research than the taking of and presentation of photographs at high magnifications? \n\nThe apparent doctrine of the amyloid clumping must surely have had other foundational features than the high resolution photographs. If so, what were they and would they have been equally vulnerable to manipulation and fraudulent presentations by a very large percentage of the research group's personnel? \n\nReplication of experimental protocols would have also generated comparable photographs as well as other allied data, which would have then been analyzed and compared by many members of unrelated research groups. Was this the normal method by which the fraudulent behavior came to light? The author does not really indicate this either.",

There is some decent research showing that Selegiline HCL, a drug long used in treatment for Parkinson's, can also be helpful for Alzheimer's Disease \u2014 more helpful than the currently approved drugs, and much, much less expensive. But clinical trials will never be done on drugs that won't make money for  pharmaceutical companies.\nIn addition, in many fields, such as my own (clinical psychology), new treatments are not developed because researchers do not receive as much credit (or money) if they build on, or test, the research of others. They all want their own \"brand.\" So psychotherapy has not improved for the past 50 years, but there are a multitude of new brands, that are basically the same as the old ones.",

        "I suppose this has little or nothing to do with the author's point about research ethics, but I was struck by the assertion that Alzheimer's disease, at least in its final stages, steals \"the very identity that makes each of us human.\" \"Identity,\" at least in this context, is a tough concept to wrap one's head around. But whatever it is, the claim that it is something one can lose, and  when that happens one is no longer human, is troubling and perhaps dangerous.

        "As a practicing scientist I have little doubt that Piller is right that the Alzheimer's research field has its problems.  But, I recognize some of the issues that Piller points to in science within his own writing.  He is forcefully presenting a particular view that might not be correct.  He does at least admit that he does not understand why the 'fraud' and 'misconduct' happen. My own view is that when a lot of effort is put in to a field where there is little certain knowledge, it becomes hard to tell the wheat from the chaff.  It's all opinion, and opinions come and go.  This is inevitable until some final understanding prevails, at which point the history of who was right and who wrong can be written (including who was rigorous and who was cutting corners).  Piller, a journalist, also fails to mention any role for journalism.  The general public does not know much about what is discussed in scientific papers, but they are bombarded by articles about Alzheimer's, its prevention and treatment, written by journalists who lack deep or nuanced understanding and present perspectives that are far from certain, no doubt including those he now criticizes.  It's difficult to know who's doing the right research.  Piller offers moral indignation but no solution.",
        "The author has done excellent work, along with Elizabeth Bik, exposing fraud in AD research.  The focus has been on the misuse of western blots. There are some other relevant facts to note.  First, there is the failure of peer review in assessing the published papers, especially when authored by powerful academics.  Second, for some companies (Cassava named here but there are others) the clinical trial data have been curated -ie manipulated.  Despite being recognized, they continue to enroll patients and neither the FDA nor SEC have shut them down. Third, it is worth noting that many of the fraudulent companies have employed the same academic \u201cexperts\u201d as consultants.  Lastly, the author mentions, but does not emphasize enough, the failure of the NIH funding process - an old boys network of ever there was one - in allocating research funding.

        "A sobering piece. As a neuroscientist who works on other topics, I understand why the Alzheimers field is susceptible to this kind of fraud. The public health stakes of AD are huge with our aging population. Given its increasing prevalence there is a large incentive to fund research on and find a cure for AD. Researchers who report significant progress receive attention and more funding. A biotech that develops an effective treatment will become wealthy. These drives can create perverse incentives to commit fraud. Given the complexity of the brain and incomplete understanding of the causes of AD, investigators seeking funding gravitate to the one hypothesis that seems testable, the amyloid plaque model, even if it proves to be wrong or only part of the answer. I've seen this consensus upon inadequate hypotheses in other fields of neuroscience, such as that which posits that long term potentiation of neurons in the hippocampus is the basis of learning. Once a field settles on a consensus hypotheseis, it is in their interest to both support research on that hypothesis and suppress research on alternative hypotheses. This is clearly happening in the AD field, at great cost in trust and patients' well being. The author has done a service in bringing this issue to attention. It is past time for the AD community to critically analyze its current hypothesis and practices. The stakes are too high to continue as is.",

For example, the author points out that the amyloid deposition hypothesis for Alzheimer\u2019s is not always correct; but this does not mean that amyloid deposition is not a causal element of the disease in many or most cases. A role for amyloid is clear from the underlying genetics of some familial cases of Alzheimer\u2019s. The real possibility that there are multiple causes for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease is not even considered here. \n\nI am not trying to minimize the consequences of fraud in science. They are terrible and cost time, money, and even the careers of honest scientists. But I am trying to point out that a disease like Alzheimer\u2019s is terribly complex and fraud is not the reason we don\u2019t have a cure. The disease itself is the reason.",
