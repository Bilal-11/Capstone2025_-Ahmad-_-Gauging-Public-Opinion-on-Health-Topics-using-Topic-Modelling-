        "Thank you, this is very eloquently put. \n\nMy thought is that the world is often shades of gray, not always black and white. As you point out, it can be harder for the human mind to manage that.\n\nRegarding your sympathetically trying to suggest that the Trump supporters check their facts, it may come as a surprise, for example, that nationwide, violent crime was higher and rising during Trump's administration while lower and declining during Biden\u2019s \u2013 and that overall, crime rates are lower for immigrants here than for others.\n\nThese are concrete facts based on actual data, though you're not likely to hear them on Fox.\n\nI'm reminded of a powerful quote from a nemesis long ago, that still rings true today:\n\n \u201cIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\u201d\n \n \u2014 Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, 1941\n\nAnd another, from an old, wise American:\n\n\u201cIt's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Mark Twain",
        "Vote, then move on.  Go watch a movie or something.  Don't spend all night watching CNN or whatever.  Don't let this eat you up.  Know that you did your tiny little part, and unless you actually have a job that empowers you to make a difference, remind yourself that nothing you do from here on will make a difference at all.  That was the lesson learned four years ago--millions of us beating our brains out for absolutely no productive purpose whatsoever.  \n\nSo just let it go and move on.",
        "It comforts me to think that the planet has been here nearly 5 billion years, and (probably) will be here after the election.",
        "While we must all respect the advice from an esteemed psychotherapist, historians and even J.D. Vance have pointed to the numerous similarities of Donald J. Trump to a German leader from the middle of the 20th century who changed world history and the inter-generational trauma that Donald J. Trump has caused should not be minimized, because while America might remain a democracy after this election, Republicans now know that every four years they will have a new chance of turning America into authoritarian nation.  The uncertainty and trauma is genuine.",
        "1. A skilled psychotherapist guides rather than gives advice.\n2. Embracing helplessness? Not today.\n3. As a psychotherapist, I encourage reflecting on what brings you joy, laughter, and a sense of appreciation. Tonight, lean into those sources of positivity\u2014perhaps with a light comedy, uplifting music, or a moment of meditation. Dinner? A hearty pasta and perhaps a bottle of wine, shared with people you love.",
        "This made me cry. Yes. We will go on regardless of what DJT and EM plan.",
        "People respond better when there is less uncertainty. They spend more, start new businesses, invest in the stock market, and buy homes.  Less uncertainty is good. \n\nOne candidate constantly threatens tariffs, denigrate women, threatens violence against his opponents, and speaks incoherently. His supporters tell the world he really doesn\u2019t mean what he says, which should generate more uncertainty. \n\nAnd yet, people vote for him and people like me worry on what he might do. People like me fear his presidency\u2014a chaotic and vindictive leader filled with uncertainty.  That is the basis for my anxiety. \n\nHarris is trying to get to common ground, trying to promote unity and less uncertainty.  If she wins,  I have less uncertainty and less anxiety.",
        "I honestly think I have PTSD from 2016. But I think the best advice I've heard so far has been what was shared by Michelle Obama. \"just do something\"  Even if it ends up being futile, at least I know I will have tried.",

        "That's good advice, especially for the long term. But tonight, I'm going with drugs and alcohol.",
        "\"Tempting as it might be, it would be far worse to give ourselves over to a man who is never uncertain, even when he is wrong.\"\nHave you heard the Biden-Harris'spin on the chaos at the Southern Border? For three years we've had record numbers of illegal immigrants and  Biden-Harris  told us they could do nothing without action by Congress. Then in 2024 they could.  Now the story is Biden-Harris have been working on a solution but it took them 3 years to develop it.\nThey're a joke.",
        "As grandma taught us, the serenity prayer (figuratively) works well and \"this too shall pass\" !",
        "I appreciate this article and it's counsel. As adults, do we not have the maturity to know where to direct our precious energies? At a certain life stage it's more likely than not that we have made it through challenging times -- perhaps even life threatening times and we are still here. Those who would exploit our fears for their purposes do so knowingly -- we must not fall for that. Our democracy is worth fighting for. There are so many examples of human strength and kindness and compassion and solidarity to draw upon.  Let us use that as fuel, reject dystopian propaganda, call forth within us the agency we have and keep moving forward.",
        "Yes- surrendering to the unknowable. It is the same skills I had to cultivate during my cancer journey. You can\u2019t make your serenity contingent on everything being \u201cok\u201d. All we can do is ask, \u201cwhere am I?- here\u201d \u201cwhat time is it? - now\u201d. What\u2019s my next right action? How can i be of service to myself and others? What is in my control?. This focus imperfectly helps me stay out of \u201csmall mind\u201d fear as much as is possible. It\u2019s the only way for me.",
        "It puzzles me that physical and astronomical science can predict perhaps to the day when and how there would (or) could be a solar or lunar eclipse perhaps decades or even centuries from now   but  5 hours after the polls open in the East coast of the United States no one could predict (at least with 100% certainty who will win this election and how both  main candidates will get in terms of popular and electoral votes. It is sobering to know that almost all of Dr Greenberg's  clients mentioned about their anxieties regarding the election and most of them are Kamala Harris supporters. As a non-American I  am also much effected by 'vicarious anxiety' (and at  times anger and resentment) as to how this man, who a very conservative- but decent- former Vice President Dick Chney has termed the most dangerous presidential candidate in United States history, gets the support or at least the votes of up to perhaps 80 million or more Americans. I think Dr Greenberg or others who specialise in mass psychology can explain this cult-like worship behaviour of the millions of mainly (but not limited to) MAGA people albeit if Trump wins by means of the electoral vote (and not popular vote) all mass psychology 'lessons 'can hardly be considered 'therapeutic'.",
        "Do things today that wont change no matter who wins and that always make you happy anyway. \n I walked thru Central Park in the warm sun and beautiful foliage and went to the gym for a good hard workout.  Came home and had a nice lunch and watched some soccer.  Donald Trump cannot take any of that from me ever.",
        "My 7 and a half years of sobriety will not be damaged if Trump wins or even, as is the nature of addiction, if Harris wins, because for me the core truths of recovery (as cliche as they seem to many) are made for a week like this: progress not perfection, the truth no matter how hard will set you free, you are not in this alone unless you choose to be, so easy does even as it helps to break all your old routines in order to put your recovery/mental health above all else, since if you don't you will eventually lose everything you put first in its place.",
        "Wonderful commentary.  When thinking of a Trump victory, I comfort myself with the idea that all Trump really wants to do is sit in the White House wearing a t-shirt that says, \"I won,\" and order McDonalds take-in.",
        "If Trump wins, I'm going to selectively obey the laws that are easy to obey and don't infringe on my ability to do whatever I want when I want.  If the president can disobey the law with impunity (per voters and SCOTUS) why can't I?  After all, the president leads are nation, right?",
        "\" I support the fears and outrage of the Harrisers, while trying, as sympathetically as possible, to suggest that the Trump supporters check their facts,\" But they wouldn't be Trump supporters if they checked the facts.",
        "What troubles me is that, when interviewed by the N.Y. Times, several Trump voters seem to feel it\u2019s okay \u2026\u2026..to forcefully resist the election results if Harris wins.",
        "Still, writing as a survivor of the Vietnam War years, of the collusions of the sixties, it hurts like hell to feel the truth of being divided from the main, of discovering that we no longer are part of any main, we are alone in our lifeboat...\nFor me, God is spirit, that which is generated by a common people on a common journey. A Trump election would mean there is no common people, no common journey. There will be an America for the rich and their suckups, and there will be an America for the rest of us who will live like refugees. No amount of psychobabble will help with the pain of that. \nWith Spirit we prosper, we awake to each and every day with hope and playful anticipation, but without that spirit, at best, we become Navalny, joining in a fight, at worst, we...well, I lived homeless for years so I can attest one can live on daydreams and illusions.",

        "Here is a simple option on to have a better day:\n\nIf you see someone homeless on the street, give them some food.\n\nIf you know, someone who is Jewish reach out to them and tell them you know the world has been really difficult for them lately and you hope any antisemitism they have felt or seen hasn\u2019t disturbed them and you are their support them.\n\nIf you interact with any service workers, give them an extra generous tip.\n\nI think if you do any one of these things that you control your day will feel better.",

        "Unease, anxiety, sleeplessness? Really! Please....\nImagine you were in command of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861 wondering whether 1/2 the nation was getting ready to kill the other half, or Abraham Lincoln about to take the reins.\nI'd be a lot more anxiety ridden if I were on the front lines in Ukraine or on Taiwan's shore gazing at China's navy zipping around the island.\n We've been through much worse and we'll get through this one way or the other. Vote and let the chads fall where they may.",
        "It's bonkers that anyone should need therapy to deal with a presidential election.",
        "Best to adopt a Zen-like approach to what may happen in the U.S. at least.\n \nMr. Trump is lazy and somewhat incompetent, characteristics that may paradoxically prevent him from doing great harm.\nHe is almost certainly going to devote his time to enriching himself and his family and to playing a lot of golf.\n\nThe biggest global risk is that those who see him as a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, like Netanyahu and Putin will take advantage as they pursue their agendas.\n\nNetanyahu in particular is rooting for a Trump victory in full expectation that the planned annexation of the West Bank and Gaza and the permanent \u201cbuffer zone\u201d in south Lebanon will be officially recognized. \n\nRemember that his friend Mr. Trump recognized the illegal annexation of the Golan, where they have named a settlement \u201cTrump Heights\u201d.",

        "Coping with uncertainty or tragedy, my experience as a retired oncologist. Both of these create stress and depending on the specifics, sometimes tremendous or overwhelming stress. With uncertainty the best you can offer is to feel that you\u2019ve done everything possible to avoid or limit the harm from a bad outcome. Once a bad outcome is verified or a reality the best that can be said is that we will get through this together. The best among us may come up with solutions that we haven\u2019t even considered and the kindest among us may contribute so much compassion that whatever the loss or final solution we can marvel at how much goodness some people are capable of.",

        "The trick is to work as hard as one can to further one\u2019s hopes, while respecting others  right to disagree. Or to be wrong. What none of us should condone is violence, racism, misogyny, or intolerance. I plan to spend this week out in Nature, listening to music, and pursuing creative interests. It\u2019s a good time for devoted self care.",

        "Beautifully written, thank you.",
        "If Harris wins great we have grown up as a nation to value a stable govt over chaos. If Trump wins he is too old to function at the hardest job in the world so he will turn it over to Musk who will be the actual dictator ,all the money ,all the power all that hubris will upset the gods.",
        "Not adding \"The Book of Woe\" if this essay is any indication.",
        "No, I will not cultivate helplessness, but resolve. Resolve that no matter what happens, we will continue to work to protect what is left of our democracy, to protect those at risk, to resist the violation of our rights, and to resist despair.  I still have hope that voters will make the choice to restore our national dignity by rejecting Trump and all he stands for but if he wins, it will open a new chapter of resistance and perhaps disillusionment with his malice and incompetence that will finally break the fever of hate and division in this country.",
        "Regardless of who wins, the fact remains that half the country will have voted for two of the most repugnant and dangerous men in our history.    They will have voted for:\n\novert racism and sexism\n\nsexual abuse\n\ncontrol over women's bodies\n\ncontrol over families\n\nmass deportations\n\ncozying up to dictators\n\nabandoning our allies\n\nlawlessness\n\npolitical violence\n\ninsurrections\n\nassault rifles and mass killings, including children\n\ndepriving millions of health insurance\n\nbook bans \n\nan all out assault on the LGBTQ community\n\nabandoning the separation of church and state\n\nthe removal of regulations and agencies that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink\n\nthe end of our democracy\n\nthe destruction of our planet, to name just a few things. \n\nNot exactly people I want to be friendly with, work with, live next door to.   So, how do we cope with this?",

        "I'm looking at my schedule today.  Would you happen to have a free hour at, say, 11pm?  There is a distinct possibility that I will need your services.  If by miracle I do not, I will be more than happy to pay just about any reasonable charge you might levy on a missed appointment.  Heck, we could also just get on the phone and rejoice together.  Gotta run; I have some prayers to tend to.",
        "My heart broke when Roe went away. I hope that was not a precursor of things I dread and fear today.\n\nSelf-enforced helplessness is an absurd and self-destructive idea. It's precisely what tyrants desire. It's the reason Jim Jones killed the children first.",

        "As a therapist myself I appreciate the author's thoughtfulness about the unique challenges this election brings for our clients (and us). However, I can't conceive of how encouraging helplessness or viewing the election outcome through the lens of a terminal illness would benefit anyone. \n\nWhat seems to help my clients the most is cultivating acceptance of what is (different than helplessness) and developing practices for coping. And probably the biggest help is to simply have someone to talk to about it, someone who will listen, have empathy, and be there for you.",
        "Thank you for this timely reflection on a basic truth. As in so many other things there is a real paradox to embrace here: that acceptance of what is to be (once you have done your part) is an act of strength, and far more empowering than railing against reality.",
        "Trump creates fear. Harris creates hope. How do people respond to a government they fear? Hopefully, we won't find out.",
        "The article describes the foundation of Stoicism: That there are two things in this world; the things we control and the things outside of our control.\n\nWe don't control what happens; we control how we respond to what happens. And we respond with courage, wisdom, self-discipline and justice (doing what's right for our fellow humans). \n\nAnd the beauty is; No one can take these character traits away from us. And thinking and acting with these four traits as the foundation of our being ensures a good life; no matter what happens.",
        "I would recommend practicing mindfulness. Use the strain from a Trump administration to focus on the present and live day to day, moment to moment.  Use it as a clarion call - what would you like to accomplish and what dreams do you want to pursue?",
        "A lot of commentators here are reassuring themselves that life will go on after the election.  If Trump gets in life will go on in the form of a dictatorship and most Americans have no idea what that will really be like.  If you feel anxious about Trump becoming president pat yourself on the back for having a healthy response.  In the meantime make a plan to combat the helpless feeling.  For example, you can join a local environmental organization to help fight climate change.",
        "Trump would likely get push back from rank and file in DOJ and enforcement, military on carrying out constitutionally questionable policy. He can't fire everyone down the chain.  Many of these will end up in court or in hearings.  Protests will be everywhere.  Certain low level appointments or promotions can be held up by anonymous holds indefinitely by a congressman or senator... this is a constitutional instrument designed for just this kind of scenario.. a party trying to load the civil service with ideological lackies and patronage appointments. They won't be able to change the rule unless they have both houses... they are predicted to get the senate but not congress.  Also, Republican sisters and daughters will start showing up (if they haven't already) with difficult pregnancies and find themselves in mortal circumstances.  His AG will be too busy in court to do much else. Would be something to see his own mob turn on him once they start feeling the pinch of his agenda (especially if he meddles with Social Security.)",
        "Yes, the only certainty is the unanticipated.\n\nBut we all have to try and make rational plans and take rational actions based on what we know, and do so as best we can. Want a house that you eventually own, you have to plan and save, etc. etc.\n\nAnd because everything is uncertain and something new always comes to our awareness, we have to change our plans when that need becomes self evident.\n\nSo we plan and change our plans as life requires, or at least we try to.\n\nThe difficulty and insanity today is that trump and his followers do not believe in verifiable facts and truth. Or care about anyone but themselves.\n\nJust absurd opinions about stolen elections, higher tariffs mean no taxes, yet tax cuts for the wealthy will help us all...and government shouldn't fund or regulate clean air, water, vaccines or anything helpful to society.\n\nI have compassion for all suffering from anxiety and depression. I hope you receive needed help. One party is more likely to care and try to help than the other. Let's vote accordingly. And hope we survive.",
        "To help cope with the potential disaster that could unfold this week, I would suggest the long version of the Serenity Prayer.\nI lean on these words during difficult times;\nGod, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference. \nLiving one day at a time, Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace; Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is; Not as I would have it; Trusting that You will make all things right if I surrender to Your will;\nSo that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with You forever in the next. (R.N.)\nAmen",
        "Not exactly a guide to handling the rolling blackouts of anxiety with the impending election. But I would suggest some breathing exercises. 4-7-8 works well. Breath of joy. There are many.

        "Looks like this therapist fell into the trap of aligning with some patients and not others because of shared political views. Never tell someone their political choices are wrong in therapy, even if they are terrible. It just serves to make patients feel bad and disturb the therapeutic alliance. And I\u2019m sure it has minimal effect on the actual outcome of the election, so there is really no point in taking sides.",
        "Yeah, helplessness ain't the answer. And I'm struggling to quell my resentment at comments by readers who resolve to start resisting if dt wins. Where have you been?  We've needed your help this year and in every election cycle since 2016 to volunteer, canvass, write letters and postcards, phone bank, drive people to the polls and cure ballots. \nI suppose It's never too late to start resisting, but those who haven't done so  until now probably lack the fervor to face being fired upon by the military and national guard.",
        "Thank yo for this. I need advice on how to forgive the Trump voters in my life. I don\u2019t want to write off decades long friendships but I am struggling.\n\nIn 2016, many friends voted for Trump and I thought at the time they were ignorant and uninformed. I can\u2019t credibly say that now\u2026",
        "Like the writer and most of his clients, I am for Harris, and thus share the concerns about Trump that many Harris fans have. \n\nWhen it comes to speculating about the fears of the other side, I'm guessing that immigrants raping and pillaging is only a small part of it. From what I have read, much of the concern of Trump supporters centers on economic issues and a feeling that they will be better off with Trump. Another big concern, I suppose, is abortion and a feeling that Harris wants to open up the abortion floodgates, or something like that. Getting dragged into foreign wars might be on the minds of some Trump voters. \n\nThere are understandable concerns on both sides, but I like to think the concerns about Trump by Harris supporters are the more rational and compelling concerns.",
        "The comments section has a surplus of people who suggest that the world will still spin on its axis after Nov.5 and things won't be that bad. These observations are a-historical and lack the knowledge of what happens when democracy is undermined and power resides in the hands of incompetent, uncaring and dangerous people. Yes, the world won't end tomorrow but if Trump wins your dread won't end as well.",

        "It seems to me a mistake to say that what we're experiencing is \"unraveling of a social fabric that once felt as certain and present as the air.\" I feel like the social fabric has been pretty tattered for as long as I can remember, which is a period that extends back to the assassinations of MLK and JFK, the riots at the Democration convention, the killing of student war protestors by government troops, etc etc etc.\n\nAs far as I can see, we Americans have always been a violent and divided lot. The idea that we once had a shared set of values is little more than a nostalgic longing for a time when disenfranchised groups kept quiet. Segregation was tacitly accepted, LGBT people stayed in the closet, women \"knew their place,\" etc. \n\nWhat we're experiencing now is not so much a loss of \"social fabric,\" but rather a disconnection from reality. It was bad enough when the MAGA folk were claiming that the pandemic, which killed millions of people all over the world, was a hoax intended to impact the US election. Now we're at the point where they're claiming, in all seriousness, that Democrats control hurricanes and use them to target Republican districts.\n\nIf someone holds a different view about taxes or immigration or whatever, I can engage that person in dialogue and we can hopefully reach some sort of understanding. If someone believes that Democrats are controlling viruses and hurricans, we've got nothing to talk about.",
        "Surely the Times could find a more helpful writer, perhaps a researcher on what actually brings piece of mind in the face of large scale problems rather than this anecdote.\n\nI personally realized that for millennia, humans have been doing unspeakable evil, and likewise have been generous in millions of usually unseen ways, daily. This current situation is horrifying, our democracy isn't seeming super capable, but if I step back at long history I found some peace knowing my focus can be on my actions. Whether that's resisting a wannabe dictator or doing something more local to my family or immediate community- perhaps hosting a fun dinner party... I am choosing to create beauty and justice in my actions, and doing so in community.\n\nThat thought has helped sleep better recently.",
        "As a Psychologist, when a client states that they have election anxiety, I encourage them to share those feelings and fears. Otherwise, their mind will try to deal with it by ruminating, which makes it worse. We discuss who they get support from and good coping strategies. One may be to have a busy day followed by a good movie, etc. Later, we may talk about how they can use their participation to help a future election.

Psychotherapy tries to understand the views and values of every client or patient, to explore underlying feelings and motivations. If in doing so, their politics change, great. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this happen in both directions: conservatives grow more open to helping the poor, liberals become more able to claim things for themselves that they previously refused in false self-sacrifice.\n\nDespite what a lot of my colleagues seem to think, psychotherapy is apolitical that way (even though it occurs in a political context, like everything else in life).

Skip ahead 75 years and the US continues to find itself unable to dominate the way it once did and it continues to slip.  So, people need to hustle more than they did once and it is hard to get paid enough.  No president is going to reverse this.  We live in a world where former colonies are now growing rapidly.

In much the same way Disneyland currently calls itself a resort (which previous generations would have laughed at) or trade schools call themselves universities, certain human conditions and behaviors have been upgraded as \"diseases.\" People used to be given credit for being stronger than that, or at least smart enough to understand that life isn't a comfy little blanky to settle in.

For those less certain, make your own pro and con table and if still uncertain of your choice ask a few of those you most respect how much factors you have selected weigh with them for a decision.   There is no need to direct a choice made by another as they give you much of their reasoning in how they weight your elements of thinking and often it gives them an opportunity to think about other factors you have not considered.\n\nMaking a choice and having your own say is useful to allaying anxiety.\n\nWhere that does not work, try looking to comedy on the events of the day.   Reruns of whatever you can find of Reflecting Fools or Daily Show reports may be skewed to some end uncomfortable to a viewer, but having a laugh at some of the ridiculous nature of how we treat an election is often helpful to detach the absurdity of what our Nation moves through from the choice itself and laughter is nearly always helpful if it can be managed.\n\nTaking events too seriously or worrying about what might happen are natural, but neither is terribly productive of anything much healthy in their application.\n\nBeing optimistic is helpful for those who can maintain optimism, but where that is unnatural, optimism cannot be forced.\n\nHumanity has overcome a good deal worse than the present threats!",

What would the Supreme Court say if Trump won the popular vote in a landslide, yet the electoral college decided Harris to be the winner? I am certain they would not make the same decision for Harris.",
        "You can choose hope over all else. You do have the power.\n\nIt's human nature to procrastinate and that is about all things: including the self awareness that to think good thoughts might lead to good outcomes which of course, will make you feel good. \n\nIt's all the small details that we can take charge of easily throughout the day that can lead to a big day. Do we not sleep better (and recharge) when we feel like we have accomplished something? \n\nTruly, how hard is it to vote? Sure, you may have to jump through some republican hoops and stand in line for a long time, and perhaps some other things. \n\nHowever how joyous is to be inclusive in communion of your fellow citizen and the direction for the country? (let alone your own life?) \n\nTake charge, Vote = feel much. much better. Win."
