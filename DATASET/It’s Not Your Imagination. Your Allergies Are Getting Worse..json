        "I hope journalists follow up with the oil executives about Trump\u2019s offer of a deal to them \u2014 give him 1B in exchange for wiping out the climate progress made under Biden.",
        "Thank you for this.  I thought it was weird that my husband is still suffering from allergies this late in the year and Margaret Renkl's piece helps explain why.  Fortunately the over-the-counter stuff works OK to control it, but who knows if there are side-effects from extended use over the long-term.  Overall, the changing climate is having a macro and very micro impact.",
        "Climate change is a very slow process.  From 2018 to 2021 the mean temperature rose by about 0.03 C (0.05 F).  If the rate of hay fever tripled, as Renkl suggests, there must be another cause.  More likely, irregular fluctuations in timing of rainfall, or El Nino.",
        "Thank you for including Trump's statement. That's all we need to know about this man's and his party's morality and priorities.",
        "My ENT doctor recommended doing a daily saline rinse via a neti pot and compared it to washing one's hands. Works like a charm!",
        "42 years old and I'm experiencing my very first bout of seasonal allergies in 2024.",
        "Not those plant allergies but the chemical ones. Try to figure out which chemical is the cause is an impossible task. And this includes the additives in pharmaceutical prescriptions.  The last five years has seen a wave of every soap producing hives and prescriptions with known allergy producing chemicals as \"additives\".",
        "I wear mask when I go out, a habit developed during Covid time. It helps reduce pollen effect. Wearing glasses also helps. I  take showers before I go to bed and change clothes every day and wash them every week. Still, pollen effected me but not as severe as I need to take medications.",
        "Animals are not immune\u2026here in NH, horses are showing signs of seasonal allergies, as are dogs.  They are also sensitive to the presence of new species\u2019 pollen.  I developed seasonal allergies i5 years ago, and have never had them before.  I\u2019ve lived in the area for over 60 years, and have farmed for most of those.  Now I have hay fever? Oh, yay.",
        "\"My husband turns away from me to sleep because the pollen grains clinging to my hair make him sneeze, too.\"\n\nWhile you don't have control over climate change, you can fix this.\n\nTake a shower and wash your hair before bed. This will remove most of the pollen from your body.",
        "If schools and businesses installed enough filtered ventilation to avoid viral infections, they would also prevent sneezing, wheezing, stuffed noses and watery eyes.",
        "I developed spring allergies in my 40s and needed 3 meds through the season until I started acupuncture.  I schedule 3 appts, one week apart in the last weeks of winter and have not needed any allergy meds for years.  It works!",
        "I\u2019ve been happy with local wildflower honey infused with pollen. It\u2019s like bee sting therapy. Exposure therapy to pollen. Worked for me.",
        "I have chronic bronchitis compounded by seasonal allergies. Long ago, there was a liquid medication called Novahistine Expectorant. The military referred to it as APC, All Purpose Cure. Every spring and fall, my PHP would write a script for me, I would go to the local pharmacist, and from under the counter came one of the unsung wonder drugs of the 20th Century. A swig directly from the bottle took care of everything, and, with a not insignificant amount of codeine contained therein, even if it didn\u2019t, it did. Sinus problems? Allergies? No problem. Hernia, dislocated shoulder, ear wax, a disruptive student? Bring it. Not quite the Salk vaccine, but still one of my all time favs.",
        "Like most here, I am not an allergist - although I do work for an allergy organization. If your husband is suffering from the pollen that accumulates in your hair, try showering at night before bed. Then neither your husband nor you will be rolling around in pollen throughout the night.",
        "This increase in pollen also affects people with asthma, nothing to fool with. I guess I should be grateful that here where I live in Northern California is nowhere near as bad as what folks in your state are suffering.",

        "Ad for humans. Good for plants.",
        "The ecological impact of a warming climate reveals the complexity of our planet with unexpected consequences like increasing air pollution from natural sources like pollen. We have tried to control nature and failed and we certainly have abused it.",
        "And yet, when my I ascribe my \"worst hay fever in decades\" to climate change, most people immediately deny it.  We are all frogs in a heated pot.",
        "So it's not just me.  I go outside and my nose signals it needs to be wiped.  Often caught without Kleenex and when I rub my nose against my sleeve I contemplate what I learned as to why decorative buttons on the cuffs of military jackets!  \n\nYes,  I think Trump's decision to ask for bribes/donations from the oil companies can? be considered a crime?   At the least it should amount to election interference.  I need to read some informed person's opinion piece on the topic. \n\nBTW time to change the Constitution.  Obviously, having a single executive in the executive branch is a mistake.  I am thinking one from each party might do the trick.",
        "Thanks Margaret, you're the best!",
        "Dear Margaret, Thank you for your excellent work, but could you please put paragraphs like your last one, about how Donald Trump is the declared enemy of our natural world, at the top of columns like this? Your paper has not treated Trump's threat to our environment and the climate with the seriousness it demands, so it's up to the columnists who care to point these things out.",
        "I am not a scientist and this is purely anecdotal but: My allergies cleared right up when I was pregnant. I had an adult-onset tree nut allergy and no longer have it. But, my allergies have been slowly returning three years postpartum to my pre-pregnancy levels of misery (I breast fed my son for 28 months so I think it extended the respite). I can't help but wonder where hormones come into play here.  I wonder if what we're eating and what we're exposing ourselves to in our atmosphere (not just pollen) is also playing a role in making our allergies worse. Again, I'm not a doctor or a scientist...it just makes me wonder.",
        "Increased pollen is also due to preference of planting male trees over female trees. Cities do this with many trees like gingko because the female tree fruit can be undesirable. This makes pollen so much worse.",
        "Last year (age 70)  was the worse allergy season of my life here in Connecticut from March thru June. This year I have not  had any symptoms. It is a wonderful improvement to my sense of wellbeing  not having sneezing fits, congestion, flu-like symptoms, itching eyes, palatal itching and so on.  I have nothing to point to for the radical change.  My blood pressure prescription medicine has not changed in the last five years. My only supplement is D3 and that has been consistent for the last five years also. My allergy history is  Maryland flora (April to June)  from my teen age years until I left at age 47. Then  central Florida for 15 years where after a couple of sneeze free years, I developed allergies to their flora, also. Then back to Connecticut for 10 years, where my  spring allergies immediately resumed.  Recent (April) blood work shows nothing adverse going on. I last had the Pfizer Covid booster last October but  never have had Covid nor flu for decades. \n\nI have commented on having a craving for Baklava that went unsatisfied for two years when a big box retailer ceased offering it in the spring.  This year I ordered Baklava from a supplier in Northern Virginia, close to where I grew up in suburban MD.  Next year I will  skip the Baklava and see what happens. Science says, \"no way\". Common sense says \"hmmm\".",
        "The list of negative impacts of climate change grows longer every year, yet by all accounts, Donald Trump\u2019s support in battleground states keeps growing as well. Do those folks not have allergies, or high insurance bills, suffer in heat waves, get flooded out of their homes or threatened by wildfires? Don\u2019t they see that climate influences increases in migration?  Are they incapable of connecting the dots and seeing that their support of a climate-change denier exacerbates their problems?",
        "How about planting fewer ornamental grasses and non-fruiting fruit trees, and planting native plants and wildflowers instead? In addition to climate change causes, there is also the influence of homeowners who want \u201cpretty things\u201d growing in their yard that do not actually belong there (including lawns). We can do better by ourselves and our neighbors by being conscientious of this and stop making things worse.",
        "Allergist here: agree, everything Ms Renkl says is true and has been noted in our journals.  Ms Renkl, I\u2019m sure Tennessee has many fine allergists and looks like it may be time for you to see one and start allergy immunotherapy treatment.",
        "+ Just plain dirty air. \n\nDoubling the population everywhere means more cars, trucks, buses, and airplanes spewing in the air...with few places to live now to escape the building, rebuilding and sprawl that denudes the landscape. The one constant environmental collision is human fecundity with consumer folly.",
        "As Ms. Renkl has shared in past columns, leaf blowers also are a detriment to all of the tiny creatures (insects, etc.) that live in the grass. Additionally, they deprive the earth and plants of the nutrients that fallen leaves and grass clippings return to the earth, courtesy of Mother Nature.",
        "What is the connection to age? WHy do allergies become more severe with age?",
        "I had great luck with Flonase usually need to use it a week. Maybe two and then I'm pretty well over it.",
        "From what I understand, allergies can be genetic. If one or, especially, both of your parents have allergies, you're likely to get them as well.",
        "My allergies receded then disappeared in the last two years. I think it's exposure therapy and because I work out all the time since covid, whereas, before, I was more sedentary and stayed indoors more often. My path is mine, and everyone's body is different, but maybe a change in diet, exercise, and quality outdoor time could be helpful for some people in the long run.",
        "I love MR's columns and read them faithfully every week.  But there was what I consider a faux pas today:  she used my least favorite but most abused-by-overuse word.  I mean \"challenging.\"  Here is a word that used to have a fairly narrow scope--duels, or such--but now everything is a challenge.  It stands in for painful, difficult, unpleasant, goal-oriented work or play, getting out of bed and going to work.  You name it, it's challenging.  Can we give up the use of the almost infinite variety of the English language for a a worn-out word?",
        "For me, my allergy problem turned out to be with histamine build up.  I use to have season allergy and was getting worse and worse.  Few years ago, I gotten sick  and caused all sorts of problem for me. I could not figure out what was causing this.  Finally a gastroenterologist told me to take probiotics for the inflammation in my endoscopy exam.  now I my seasonal allergy are very mild.  Watch what you eat, it makes a world of difference",
        "I\u2019ve never had allergies. Then, I got the Covid vax, and all the sudden I have extremely bad allergies. I wonder if there is a connection\u2026",
        "Here in Central Florida, it's always been a thrill to watch rocket launches from our backyard. But, the increasing number of such launches (every other day, it seems like) now makes me cringe as all I can think about is the thousands of pounds of fuel being burned into the atmosphere with each launch. Plane travel is said to be a major driver of air pollution but I haven't yet seen anyone quantify what rocket launches are doing to our planet. Let's not even get into the wars being fought!",
        "I've never had allergies.  I attribute this to spending a lot of time outdoors exposed to dirt and the humid environment as a child and young adult. My parents didn't believe in air conditioning unless company was coming; you could go outside in the shade with an iced drink. And perhaps genetics and a heaping helping of luck also played a role.",
        "This is the first year our snow fall was almost negligible and our really cold weather was short lived. I can't imagine how the wildlife must feel with these crazy temperatures or what the insects and plants must do to adapt to stay alive.  And I cannot fathom the utter contempt Trump and the oil barons have for our country and the world they continue to pillage with absolute impunity.",
        "I have found the N95 mask to be very helpful in lessening exposure to pollen. Makes sense as that mask also eliminates most smoke.",
        "Allergies are so strange! I had terrible allergies as a child, developed new ones in my 20s, and then after my body went haywire from my Covid infection, I tested negative for all previous allergens on three separate tests. Yet, I still have what feel exactly like allergic reactions, and my allergist says it's non-allergic rhinitis, so I remain on the same three meds as before to manage the symptoms. Bodies are weird.",
        "I'm both glad and worried to know it's not just me. Our retailers have seemingly caught on as well. Target has allergy meds prominently on display like candy in October.",
        "Forbes noted that 96% of political donations were going to Republicans in the current cycle in an article by Sara Dorn and others just a few days ago (May10th).    That article note a mere 537K USD to Biden and some 7.3M USD to Trump in the current election cycle.    Biden and his environmental position is clearly not as much to the taste of those in the petrochemical industry.\n\nOn the other hand, 1B USD is clearly a very much greater investment than the 7.3M USD already invested and my suspicion is that asking for that amount will not be likely to get much of anywhere close to that amount.\n\nWhether the industry is even ready to pony up a quarter of that amount is perhaps difficult to see in the face of the cyclicity of the market performance and the focus on dividend earnings and CEO salaries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Petrochemical industry has hedged its bets a bit.  Deloite posts 2024 renewable energy performance in Solar and storage at roughly 50% of the proposed support, Wind at nearly 95% of the support proposed and Hydrogen at a mere pittance.\n[deloite.com/us/en/insights/research-centers/center-energy-industrials.html ]\n\nThe outlook at least is not a total horror show, but it could be a good deal better.\n\nI worry a good deal more about cancers than I do about allergies.  Many petrochemicals as fumes contribute to lung damage, but hydrocarbons such as kerosene, turpentine and a good many others contribute to hematologic and urogenital malignancies.",
        "I had terrible allergies as a young man. I got shots for all the 50 allergies I tested positive for. Afer 4 years of shots I was cured. I also believe as I aged I grew out of these allergies. \n\nI noticed my father no longer complained of hay fever and he never got shots. \n\nmy son never got allergic to spors in NY where he grew up but only in CO where we summered. He still suffers from those but he is getting shots too.  \n\nThe shots seem to be worthwhile",
        "Thank you for ending this story by emphasizing the threat Trump poses if re-elected. Any recent progress our country has made to tackle the climate crisis, pollution, species loss, and habitat destruction will be lost. It's just so heart-breaking to contemplate.",
        "I think two effects are happening together. We do have warming that is increasing the Pollen and here in Portland Mold spors. We are also getting older. As a kid, I would from time to time get hay fever, my mom would give me one of her antihistamines. That would stop the symptoms and I was so young strong, and energetic that I wouldn't notice the drozeness or anything else. Now not having that 15-year-old body I think that same pollen has more effect. I don't think I'm more sensitive I'm just weaker. I hate to admit that.",
        "I have had allergies and lived in the South my entire life.  A allergist recommeded Astepro this year.  It works for nasal congestion/post-nasal drop.  It is an anti-histamine delivered nasally.  Went OTC in 2021.  Everyone that I have recommended it to is having similarly stellar results.",
        "Such a good article.  For me pollen allergies turn into sinus infections on a regular basis, even with using nose sprays\n(one an Rx) twice a day.  Our dry California small town right in our back yard got 70 inches of rain in two winters after years and years of drought.  What a magnificent spring, every plant growing up out tall wide thick blooming, trees knowing Paradise has arrived and I rejoice and sneeze sneeze sneeze. So interesting that carbon dioxide increasing in turn increases the pollen load.\nCould that be the dandelion effect....changing threats call on plants to expel pollen/seeds so progeny survives?",
        "I wish this article was a bit more thorough about presenting the causes of increased allergies rather than just saying the plants are moving north and there is more carbon in the air. \n\nBotanical sexism wasn't mentioned, and it is one of the leading theories. \n\nUrban planners in the 50s and 60s largely only used male trees in urban areas, for fear of any cleanup related to the fruit. I'm sure it had more to do with capitalism, but that's what they did. \n\nSo the trees 'know' how much pollen they have to produce in order to have a chance at pollination. Scientists are discovering that trees are aware of their surroundings through mycorrhizal networks underground and possibly even have a capacity for 365-degree vision. \n\nMy guess is that if they can't sense any females in their area, they will produce more to compensate. Just a hunch.",
        "This is why I use a broom on the deck and a rake in the yard. I can't stand the noise from blowers, and the more manual process is meditative.",
        "Lots of advice here, from cleaning our your colon to nettles to air purifiers, but I find the \"better living through chemistry\" approach works best for me - two Sudafed, two Benadryl, and four ibuprofen. The pseudoephedrine both unclogs you and counteracts the drowsiness of the Benadryl, which means this remedy can be taken during the day.",
        "Fighting global warming is a must, but pisotive developments at that front won't help you in the next years, probably decades, Mrs. Renkl. I'm afraid you should consider moving. What are you doing in reactionary Tennessee in the first place, what's the upside? How about a desert region, where pollen are rare, like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico? Maybe just for a part of the year?",
        "Try CoQ-10.",
        "You people in the US have brought it all on yourself. As the worlds most (or second most) polluter all these \u2018unusual\u2019 weather events are now usual. You need to stop polluting, that is if it isn\u2019t already too late.",
        "Ah, Ms. Renkl. Let us commiserate together!",
        "Great. Now every sneeze will call forth an image of Trump. Gaaaaa!",
        "At this point your sinuses are pretty inflamed which makes them swollen. You might try an NSAID like Motrin to bring some relief.",
        "Year-round allergies here, so I get your misery folks.  Box of tissues in every room and I carry a pack in my pockets at work.  I don't blame Mother Nature for making my life uncomfortable, though.   She is just reacting to being poisoned by humans.    Earth is hurting way more than we are.",
        "My advice is to clean you colon out.  Most people in the west want to take something to relieve their condition when it is more about eliminating something.  Poor dietary practices and lifestyles are more to blame, not pollen.  Springtime and pollen have been around longer but we are getting sicker from it...makes no sense...it is what we are doing..not the trees",
        "Thanks Ms. Renkl.\nSo, another gift of climate change.  I wonder what else is coming up that we don't yet know about.  The natural world is going to\nexact a huge price for how humans have misused it for so long.",
        "Allergy to the Queen Palm tree in Florida.  Thinking of moving North.  Hard to imagine!!",
        "The Vanderbilt allergy clinic would be delighted to help you with your allergies, Margaret.  Big fan of your writing and would not want you to miss out on the great outdoors or your garden due to allergies.",
        "Nice piece! My allergies have definitely gotten worse in recent years, and I appreciate the explanation.  Would have greatly preferred it had partisanship been kept out of the article, simply by deleting the last paragraph: so gratuitous and unnecessary, but irresistible to some, I suppose.",
        "Bravo my fellow alergy person. If there was a cure for toxic politicians it would help.",
        "If you haven\u2019t already, please read the last paragraph! Thank you for drawing attention to something we can actually do that will have an impact. Vote!",
        "Have you tried a high quality air purifier at night while you sleep?  You might get some relief for those hours.  IQ Air, very expensive but works.",
        "HOW TO CURE YOUR ALLERGIES:    Eat freeze dried stinging nettle capsules!    It really works.  I had vicious hay fever for 40 years.  Almost disabled me in the spring.   A friend told me this and I bought a bottle of the capsules, take two a day, and my hay fever and allergies are GONE.   Completely.  No kidding.  Why does it work?   Because hay fever is caused by histamine reactions.   Stinging nettles cause a painful itchy rash that is a histamine reaction.   So if you eat the freeze-dried nettles in capsules, they set off a whole-body anti-histamine response.   You can read the reviews of this on Amazon and other sites.  It really works.  Get a bottle for $14 or so and STOP SNEEZING FOREVER.",
        "I can\u2019t speak to the longer growing season but I have experienced more intense allergies over the past few years. Then in 2020 when I was wearing a mask all the time I didn\u2019t have any symptoms. \n\nThe next few years I had chronic sinusitis. This year \nI began wearing the mask again outside. I\u2019ve had minor symptoms but nothing like it was. I\u2019ll continue wearing the mask.",
        "I had terrible environmental allergies as a child that have all but vanished as an adult. I do sometimes wonder if deciding to have a massive indoor garden (in my bedroom as well) helped me somehow ditch them?\nAs my home has gotten \"less clean\" things have improved. I do wonder if there is a correlation.",
        "Those of us older Americans with severe asthma and allergies are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine.\n\nI developed severe asthma and allergies as a toddler. Many of us older patients have severe airway scarring. Asthma is often a serious disease, not one that should be joked about in sitcoms, with the nervous young kid grabbing his rescue inhaler. Yet we still see this portrayal of asthma, ignoring that many of us are suffering from serious airway constriction, either recurrent or permanent.\n\nOur allergies often trigger our asthma attacks as Ms. Renkl notes. And for those of us who have had the disease for decades, this is truly a disability and not a mere \"nuisance\". I myself take four doses of steroids daily, and inject myself with a biologic twice a month to control my asthma. And with all this, my lung capacity is only about 60% of what it should be for my age. \n\nI don't give short shrift to those handling the watery eyes and runny noses of this season. I have these, too. But many of us with serious asthma wish allergies were all we had. Instead, we need to be always vigilant against an asthma attack that may send us to the emergency room. \n\nAs for climate change, well, I moved to Arizona more than 50 years ago, when it was a haven for asthmatics. Regrettably, too many other folks moved here too, and I now live in a large, urban area with frequent poor air quality readings. Thankfully I can get away from town, and out in the desert occasionally, to get some relief.",
        "If you have hay fever. don't drink wine during pollen season.  Don't eat or drink anything fermented like mushrooms, cheese, etc.  Those will raise your allergy threshold and cause you to have symptoms.Note when you have an outbreak of sneezing and coughing and remember what you've recently imbibed or eaten - for instance, wine the night before.",
        "Ms.Renkl: Every morning when I get out of bed and sit down with some coffee, I start what I call my daily phlegm fest\u2014sneezing, blowing my nose so often that my tissue cube is depleted in 2-3 days. When I get into my vehicle to do some shopping in town, pollen covers it\u2014including inside, though windows are always closed. \nAs a kid, I remember I had \u2018hay fever\u2019 in August in NE PA. But now, in SE PA and, it seems everywhere, it started in April. I\u2019m an old gardener, and last year, it broke my heart to take out three of the five huge, raised perennial because, at 75 and with neuropathy, I could no longer maintain all of them. I still have four good-sized beds. \nThey need tending, and once the constant rain stops, I hope to spend three hours each day to do that, once the morning phlegm fest is over. A box of tissues will be added to my garden-tending tools of trowel, fork, dandelion digger, and a serrated knife. \nOver 50 years of gardening  in the Berkshires, MA, in NE PA, and now in SE PA, I have certainly noticed climate change. And it ticks me off more than I can express (other than by voting) that any incremental progress with, hopefully, more to come, will be undone.",
        "We have about 8.1 billion human beings to feed.  The majority of these are fed through the efforts of farmers and ranchers, who raise the vegetables, grains, and animals we eat.\n\nLonger growing seasons make this possible.  Longer growing seasons are a good thing.  \n\nBetter growing conditions for corn and wheat are the same better conditions for white pine, ragweed, goldenrod, maple and myriad other plants that reproduce via pollen and flowers.  \n\nThe same people that buy bidets so they can feel good about not using toilet paper made from trees complain when the trees are healthier and the natural environment is booming -- or when there are too many bambis feasting on their ornamental bushes (and dropping deer ticks) in their yards.  \n\nFolks, you can't have it both ways.  If you want thriving forests, and chose to live in them, then you get the whole wonderful package.",
        "Your diet greatly affects your allergies. If your body is already suffering from inflammation, you will more likely be affected.",
        "I have done my own research about the lengthening growing season by timing the Virginia Bluebells, my favorite wildflower, and it's been alarming.  The bloom just as few years ago was in mid to late April, and now it's late March to early April.  This year just north of Baltimore we had dandelions in bloom in January, and there have been some in bloom constantly since late 2023.",
        "I've always had itchy eyes during allergy season. But this year, I got very sick in April. Urgent care claimed it was allergies. The cough has lingered. It comes and goes and feels like my throat is tingly or burning and wheezing. My kid has a mucus producing cough and extremely runny nose. They're tired. I'm having trouble believing allergies could cause this much issue. My spouse remains symptom free through all of this, though. So, I am suspicious of allergies. But if so, this is horrible news.",
        "My spouse and I suffer from congestion and rhinitis. We both got enormous relief from a intra-nasal laser surgery procedure performed by an ENT. The procedure is  called a turbinate reduction, and it takes only a few minutes in the doctor's office under a local anesthetic. You're able to drive yourself home and go back to work the next day. It takes a few weeks to fully heal, but relief increases gradually during this period.  We still use various prescription steroid inhalers, antihistamines, etc., but this has been very effective in reducing our allergy symptoms.",
        "Yes, never before this year have I had a persistent cough in Spring or itchy eyes.\n\nAnd, it should be pretty obvious to anyone who gardens that climate change has fully taken hold this year. While my area has not experienced disastrous weather yet, the change is obvious. We have had far more cloudy and rainy days than sunny ones this past Fall, Winter and Spring. We've had lots of rain but not much snow because it's been unseasonably warm. As a result, our flowering trees and shrubs are truly gorgeous this year -- flowering cherries, magnolias, dogwoods, forsythia, azaleas. I've never seen them like this.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather have to shovel snow than worry about mold, flooding, drought and unbearable Summer heat, and admire Spring blooms.",
        "In addition to pollen, as I grow older I find myself more sensitive to radical changes in weather from day to day, or even during a day. \n\nAt least here, we have had more wild swings back and forth, instead of the steady arrival of Spring that I remember. I attribute that to climate change as it warms us sooner but unevenly, unpredictably.\n\nBut then, maybe that is just the biased memory that also comes with getting older.",
        "Go to an allergy doctor! My allergies have never been treated better. The herbal stuff doesn\u2019t work; science-based medicine does.",
        "Although pine pollen makes a yellow mess on cars and porches it  does not cause the majority of people any allergic symptoms . \nAlso taking off all your clothes when you come inside and put them in the washer ,rinse  your hair or if you can jump in the shower. All that r is necessary for people who suffer as you described. There are ways of mitigating symptoms especially running noses and coughs but the worst for me is the crushing  fatigue .\nI also wear a N95 mask when doing any outside activities plus good wrap around sunglasses to stop pollen from entering our systems. \nI live in the woods!",

        "OK.  I\u2019m not a scientist nor a shill for Big Olive Oil :). But here\u2019s what I know that may help some of you.  \n\nNYC in 1990 I developed intense spring allergies and took  over the counter allergy meds.  It was all so bad.I could not breathe, sneezed relentlessly and had eyes so itchy I was afraid I\u2019d scratch them out. \n\nI also suffered from side effects of various meds in the ensuing years.  Very bad side effects.  Seldane, Claritan, Flonase among others.\n\n Around 2010 someone told me her father took a tablespoon of olive oil first thing in the am and then at the end of the day for nasal polyps that kept coming back.  I did this for about a month and it seemed to help.  \n\nMaybe that olive oil really helped. I no longer take it. BUT what I do know  is that getting off the allergy meds was key I believe that while they gave me temporary relief, long terms they  suppressed my ability to adapt to the pollen.  So while allergies are getting worse and worse, mine got better and better to the point where on some days I\u2019ll sneeze just a handful of time.  \n\nI hope this helps.  I know how horrible allergies can be.",
        "I had allergies growing up in Chicago 50 years ago. I would take those medications that made me drowsy but gave me relief. May was the worst month: itchy eyes, running nose, sneezing.\n\nI remember some times in the past decade (I now live in LA) when I visited other places and my allergies got so bad I couldn't see. Thanksgiving 2010 in La Quinta near Palm Springs. April 2015 in Riverside Park in NYC. Claritin to the rescue.\n\nBut I read that running helps create antihistamines that fight allergies. I run. And when I run I seem to sneeze less, my allergies are less severe. \n\nThis year I got plantar fasciitis on the bottom of my right heel. So I have temporarily given up running.\n\nAnd now my allergies have gotten worse.",

In the past, mold counts were reported, but I haven't seen reports from most sources in the past several years. Mold can also come from indoor sources. The most noticeable source is from outside, from mold on dead or even live leaves, grass, and blowing farm dust. Local mold gets considerably worse 12 to 48 hours after a local shower.\n\nMy allergy discomfort may be better due to climate change because the change seems to include drier weather for hundreds of miles west of me.",

Luckily right off the exit was a fire station, where an EMT gave me a breathing treatment. He gave me directions to the closet doctor's practice. He prescribed an inhaler and an OTC medication. \n\nWary of ragweed since then.But being a gardener I'm outside constantly. My gardening zone use to be 6A, 35 years later it's zone 7B, with some parts of the garden qualifying for zone 8.

They have conspicuous flowers to attract insect pollinators \u2014 their pollen is too heavy to be carried by the wind. \n\nThat wildflowers in general cause hay fever is a fairly widespread misconception. Just yesterday, on CBS Mornings, science reporter David Pogue commented that people with hay fever would appreciate fake flowers because they don\u2019t have pollen \u2014 of course those are not the kinds of flowers that cause hay fever. \n\nThe most common examples of this misconception that I\u2019m familiar with are the goldenrods, beautiful plants with showy flowers that attract lots of insect pollinators. Goldenrods are not wind pollinated - that\u2019s why they have those showy flowers. If you want to have a pollinator garden, goldenrods are a great choice to include. It may give you opportunities for teachable moments with your neighbors (or you can plant them only in your back yard if you\u2019re worried that neighbors will be concerned).",

        "It's paramount to understand the role of air pollution in allergies.\n\n1. High air pollution makes allergens in pollen more aggressive, for example in birch trees (protein Bet v1), and explains the failure to treat allergies in polluted areas.*\n2. Animal studies have confirmed that if diesel exhaust particles get into the lungs together with pollen, the damage they do is exponentially larger (by increasing Th2 sensitization to coinhaled allergens).\n3. Air pollutants interact with epithelial surfaces, induce inflammation and disrupt epithelial barriers, trigger immune reactions leading to acute or chronic inflammation.**\n\nReduce air pollution by stopping to burn fossil fuels - first diesel, the most harmful one, then gas in cars \u2013 raise kids on a farm (the so-called \"farm effect\", amply proven), farm dust and endotoxins would protect them from becoming allergic later in life.\n\nThe phrase \"Allergy apocalypse\"  is hyperbole and not helpful - there're reasons for this trend and it can be reversed.\nIf there were only electric cars, they'd probably be as many allergies as 50 years ago.\n\n* Stawoska I et al.
