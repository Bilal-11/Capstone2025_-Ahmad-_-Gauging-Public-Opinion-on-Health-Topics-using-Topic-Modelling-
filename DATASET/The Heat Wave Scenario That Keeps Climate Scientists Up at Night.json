Either by air or driving.  Both of which dump more megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere which will lead to more high temps and storms.\n\nI wonder who is going to blink first at the climate poker table... the people suffering from heat or the people dumping megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere????",

This inequality underlies its mass killings that are often reported here, yet eliding this context. (This is one of several reasons that I cannot reasonably accept what NYT claims at face value.)\nThe fact climate laws are deeply inequitable or unjust helps show how and why the rule of law violates the rule of justice. Instead of keeping quiet about such injustice, climate scientists should study ethics and political science to formulate ethical answers that could solve the problem.",

I believe that the priorities of the military-industrial complex are focused on preparing for traditional warfare, which is not focused on the overheating of Planet Earth due to global warming, which is the cause of global climate change.  This scenario reminds us that, indeed, we are all in it together.  Some states have made a good start by offering free solar panels and cells in the transition to sustainable generation of energy.  Before starting families, many of us boomers posed the question, What kind of planet are we leaving our children?  The threat of lethal heat waves, with no end in sight, are the kind of planet we're leaving our children.  What can we do protect the Earth in general?  The odds are far higher than those that the US faced in the Manhattan Project, designed to produce nuclear weapons.  Our greatest enemies are those who are climate change deniers.  We must put our difference aside, to the extent possible, to protect the Planet Earth in order to ensure the viability of all of its species.  That is a starting point.  We have archaeological proof of past civilizations that died because of climate change.  We owe it to future generations to rescue the planet Earth as best we can as the top priority of human endeavors, starting NOW!",

        "Global heating is not trending up in a straight line.  We are at the start of a spike.\nWhy?  Because all of our climate positive feedbacks and tipping points do not happen by themselves.  They all interact.\nFor example.  In the last Antarctic summer (our winter) floating ice in the nearby oceans had declined by about a million square miles.  And dark oceans absorb a lot more heat than white ice and snow.  So the reduced ice will cause MORE melting.\nBut the added heat from melted ice will have a world wide effect.\nIt will cause faster melting of the perma-frost in Siberia and Canada, releasing more CO2 and methane = more warming.  \nAnd more forest fires, ditto.\nFor climate scientists the effect of all these interacting positive feedbacks is very difficult to accurately calculate.  Which is why, every 5 years or so, they tell us, well - it's happening faster than we previously imagined.\nIt is very likely that these positive feedbacks are now turning into irreversible tipping points, which will all interact.\nCan we reduce our carbon emissions fast enough?\nWe'll see.  But it will require vast social and economic changes, which will NOT occur under politicians who are wedded to the fossil fuel companies.",

Do any of these stories actually recognize that the planet has so many people that extreme events are apt to affect more people because...there are more people? Equally more madding is the fact that looking at any one or even a series of extreme weather events is weather not climate. Climate change occurs over periods of many years (think decades, multiple decades, hundreds of years, etc). Looking at weather changes in our own life time is a blink of the eye when it comes to climate change. No doubt the last several years have been warmer but who knows, maybe where you live it will be cooler soon. I'm not trying to diminish the effects of extreme weather or climate change but extreme events are nothing new and being hysterical about it is getting really old.",

It starts with nearly 20 million people being killed in a heatwave in India, very close to where I was born. This event sparks, finally, some action. The book is wonderful, sobering, scary and packed with ideas I'd love to see discussed more in the public domain. \n\nOne unrealistic thing in the book: I couldn't bring myself to believe we, in the wealthier world, would change our habits even if millions died over the span of days in India, China or Africa. I don't think we care enough unless it's in our backyard.\n\nWe could wait until thousands die in Phoenix in a heatwave over a weekend, and then invest trillions overnight.

Here\u2019s the scenario- a trailer tractor is clearing up human junk- mainly plastic collected over past two days. Just three, obviously low paid workers manually bend and pick up the junk and dump it in the trailer. Their pace agonizingly slow because there\u2019s miles of trash to collect by these three  or a few more helping angels and the heat and humidity even at 5 am in the morning, not fatal but is bad enough. Here\u2019s my point- three (enslaved) manual low paid laborers clear up humanity\u2019s muck and the next day I come the muck, the garbage is back again waiting for the three angels to show up and clear their muck. I have been watching this over a week and especially after the weekends I film a wave during a high tide and instead of expecting to see blue green mass surging and crashing onto shore, it is lifting up literally filled with trash and dumpling it back into the shore.

        "It is the single biggest human error in solar system and Earth science research. The Earth is round and spherical and not like a pizza, which is round and flat.  To demonstrate the Earth  is round and spherical means using the maximum equatorial rotation velocity in tandem with the Earth's maxim circumference (equator). The error states a value of 1674.4 km/hr, while the correct value is 1669.8 km/hr.\n\nHere is how the correct value is derived.\n\nEvery noon-to-noon cycle, as measured by a sand clock, is unequal, so different amounts of sand would result for each cycle.\n\nIf forty samples are taken, forty different amounts will result. When those forty samples are combined into a single amount and then divided equally, an average amount for those forty cycles will be obtained.

        "1/2  We see the evidence that just like the organs of the human body the elements of the earth system are causally coupled together, and if you tip one you're going to have consequences for others. \n\nMost notably we know that the Arctic is warming four times as fast as the global average, because of the retreat of the sea ice exposing a dark ocean that absorbs far more sunlight. We know that Arctic warming is accelerating the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the permafrost which locks up more than twice the carbon that is currently in the atmosphere. \n\nArctic warming is also causing much more rainfall in the arctic that freshens up the surface of the North Atlantic ocean and contributes to an observed weakening of the great overturning circulation of the Atlantic ocean (AMOC) which kind of drags heat at the surface from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere and gives us a nice equable climate in Western Europe but also sets the position of a great band of rainfall all the way around the tropics.",
        "I live in coastal British Columbia, an area that historically enjoyed mild temperatures and where most homes lack air conditioning. During the brutal 2021 heat dome, my husband and I -- in our rented flat on the top floor of an older apartment building, with heat rising from the floors below and the sun beating on the roof above -- seriously wondered if we might die. We made lavish use of icy water bottles and got through it OK, but afterwards we looked for passive ways to keep the flat cooler without boosting the strain on electricity and pumping more heat into the atmosphere. We proposed to our landlord to professionally install, at our own expense, top-quality heat- and UV-blocking window film; he ignored our request. \n\nSo since then we have been blocking our windows with curtains and blinds, using electric fans, and putting up a balcony umbrella to block the midday sun (when the weather allows it -- powerful winds are now persisting well past the gales season). But this summer we are finally giving up and keeping a portable air conditioner at the ready. \n\nIt is beyond discouraging that private and public authorities aren't taking more seriously the urgent need for an all-out community response to this problem, but rather leaving it to us all to come up with our individual, mostly inadequate, solutions -- most of which not only add to the environmental problem, but also require a financial outlay that many cannot afford.",

In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50. \n\nSo we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural; they were caused by global warming. \n\nAn important impact, if global warming continues, will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world, the Midwest and Great Plains, which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts, worse than the Dust Bowl, within just a few decades, if we let global warming continue.\u201d\n\nThat was 12 years ago and I imagine that such anomalies now cover even more ground.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change/transcript\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change/transcript</a>",

The National Guard will show up within 72 hours. That doesn't mean they'll get everything right in 72 hours. You can expect a 10 day disruption during major events.\n\nI'm not suggesting you go build a bug-out bag right this second. However, it's useful to imagine these scenarios in your head.

        "There are two forces driving the human response to climate change that cannot be changed : \n1. Deferred gratification. The average human being wants things to be better for them now. Not next week or next month, but right now. This is apparent in the area of finance - the cost of borrowing increases with the duration of the loan. The longer the deferred use of the money, the more it costs.\n2. NIMBY - Not in my backyard. People may agree that something must be done, but they expect action at a macro level and that someone else should accomplish it, as long as it does not inconvenience them personally.   By the time they realize that the ship is on fire and sinking it is too late to do anything about it.\n  I am not optimistic about the mankinds ability to overcame these two forces to combat climate change.",

Political leadership is essential to overcome this. \n\nIn the absence of such, people will be left on their own to respond in their own way. This may be useful for them but if, in doing so, they then justify opposition to a larger social response, then it is counterproductive and destructive.\n\nFor example, how many climate disasters will it take for those with political and economic power in TX etc. to decide that a better and far more coherent plan is needed to reduce fossil fuel energy consumption, increase renewable energy sources, harden the power grid, work out mitigation plans  to improve  adaptation to great heat stresses etc. etc.? \n\nWho really knows the answer.

The hum fills the 68-degree morning air.\n\nIndividual actions aren't enough to stop climate change. We need corporate and governmental society-wide action. But if the individual decisions people continue to make every day--even easy ones that require no sacrifice (drive a smaller car, stop using plastic water bottles, open the windows when it is lovely and in the 60s and 70s) are any indication, no one truly cares enough about climate change to press for that action. It's likely the deeply engrained habits of fossil-fuel consumption won't be disrupted until catastrophe forces it.",
        "Governments listen to economists, so it is tragic that hardly any economics professors \u2013 indeed hardly any professors of ecological economics \u2013 know chemistry well enough to understand strong sustainability-assessments based on chemical sciences. People ignorant of chemistry can take stock of various ecologically important non-chemical changes, but when it comes to addressing our current ecological problems, a modicum of savvy about sciences based in turn on chemistry is likely to be indispensable. Unversities should train some potential professors of ecological economics who are savvy about chemistry as well as about finance and can thus distinguish between fake strong sustainability-assessments (such as \"Global warming is a hoax\") and strong ones drawing upon such sciences as meteorology, agronomy, and epidemiology.",
        "I wonder why companies are moving to Texas.  Taxes are lower and they have favorable labor laws for corporations.  But is heat and the crazy power system adequately considered in due diligence?",
        "A temporary emergency solution is to keep one's air-conditioned vehicle charged or full of gas before a heat wave.   Several years ago when it reached 112 here, every several hours I would bring the dog with me to the car, take a drive with the air-conditioning blasting, and do this for at least 20 to 30 minutes.  Then I would return, take a shower and wet down the dog, and use ice for coolness until another hour went by and I repeated the drive.  Here we are fortunate our climate cools down in the evening.  It is not a perfect solution, but an efficient emergency one.",
        "This is a very important article, and - like with so many pressing issues - asks us to consider and plan for scenarios that are more than likely coming for millions of people. \n\nHowever, there's no profit in that kind of planning, and our system prioritizes profit over everything else. I think the best we can hope for in the aftermath of crises like these is for citizens to volunteer (which will be wholly inadequate) and price-gouging.\n\nIt might be different if we had a government that wasn't so deeply in the pocket of capital. We couldn't stop these catastrophes from happening (that horse left the barn ages ago), but we could at least be smarter and more effective with how we address and respond to them. \n\nSorry, everyone.  We were told capitalism (and a government that lets capital do what it wants) was the best system imaginable. It sounds like we're gonna learn, one way or another, how wrong we were.",
        "A revival of ancient building principles and codes is needed whereby homes, villages and cities are laid out to capture naturally occurring energy and water flows. We live in an 1853 house that has a huge basement and windows that provide a stacking function to keep cool air coming up through the house and hot air going out to the attic. We are surrounded by deciduous trees that keeps us cool with their trees in the summer, and after their leaves fall in autumn, lets light and warmth in during the shoulder seasons. There is a sunroom on the east side that captures heat in the spring and fall that can migrate into the dining room when the door is open. The house faces south on an east-west axis providing natural light throughout the day, and is on a slight slope that allows water to come to, but also keep flowing past the house in big rain events. For a nearly 3000 sf house and 6 people, these principles, along with modern tech such as a geothermal heat pump and solar pv, we have been able to keep our utility bills below $200/month. \n\nToo late in many cases, but what could be done to retrofit places? In many instances, tree planting is a start.\n\n2 great references: The Doctrine of Ancient Lights and the book, A Golden Thread by John Perlin.",
        "I wonder which will arrive first, the climate threat here explained, or cascading human distempers resulting in similar disturbance. \nUnfortunately the climate effects described in this article are already \u201cbaked in.\u201d The continuing escalation of these effects is ramping up our human disturbances. \nParadoxically, our troubles can also energize the necessary adaptations.",
        "\"The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge. Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.\"\n\n- from David Archer's book, \"The Long Thaw: How Humans Are Changing the Next 100,000 Years of Earth's Climate\".\n(David Archer is Professor of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago)\n\n\"We are messing with the trigger that causes climate change....the outcome is likely to be ferocious.\"\n\n- Prof Russell Coope (1930-2011) who accidentally discovered that the Earth's climate can undergo abrupt changes, by studying (of all things) fossil beetles in ice age deposits.\n\nMost politicians simply have no scientific background, and certainly not in the earth sciences.\n\nThey understand politics and very little else.\n\nThey are political pied pipers, leading humanity over a climate cliff.\n\nThis isn't the Earth that our societies are adapted to - it's now an ever-changing planet, heading towards chaos:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/humanity-turns-earth-chaotic-climate-system\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.livescience.com/humanity-turns-earth-chaotic-climate-system</a>"
