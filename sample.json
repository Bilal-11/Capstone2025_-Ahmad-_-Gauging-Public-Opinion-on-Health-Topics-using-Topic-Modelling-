        "Addicts have been hiding behind the term 'disease' for decades, ever since the inception of addiction as illness. \nIt is not a disease like cancer. And we need to stop conflating it as such. It is a developed syndrome, born of behavior and habit, influenced by external elements. \nIn the end it is the individual who manufacturers the condition and only the individual who can end it. Or at least manage it.",
        "To overcome habitual abuse, one must be honest with oneself, and identify what it is that you're trying to escape, avoid, create...whatever, and deal with that. \n\nThe so-called addiction is a symptom of something else, not an actual illness.\n\nNot everyone is doing it for the same reason.\n\nThe drug, alcohol, food...is not MAKING you abuse it.",
        "I've been through all of this several times and finally after more than twenty years came out clean, but the odds were absolutely stacked against me and it took several tries in 4 different states to get where I am now. \nOne HUGE problem is the overwhelming majority of clinics are for profit, just like the very same people who sell illicit drugs on the street, for profit. WAY too much profit motive in it..And it's a hefty profit at that and they all keep less than bankers hours.  Methadone by itself costs clinics literally pennies on the dollar and they almost always jack the prices up till patients are often left to choose between a hot meal or the utter misery of withdrawal. There's typically a very small window of the day when patients can even access clinics often with overburdensome rules and staff seemingly hell bent on turning patients away for even the slightest infraction of the rules.\nClinics are typically, although not always located far away from residential areas where actual addicts live in industrial areas, off freeways usually not on bus lines or bus lines a mile or more away. Nobody wants a clinic in their neighborhood even IF the neighborhood is full of addicts stealing everything not nailed down and even if a local clinic far outweighs the risk of having a clinic close by..\nThen there's clinic staff. One of my former \"drug counselors\" was an off duty prison guard with the charm of a run down gas station toilet and that's putting is nicely to her.",
        "AA has a phrase for it:  \u201cContempt prior to investigation\u201d.  Don\u2019t let the ones who\u2019ve \u201cresearched\u201d the subject mislead you.  AA works\u2014if you want it and put in the work.  Happily sober over 26 years through AA here.",
        "Drug addiction in America?\n\nI don't think it can be adequately challenged without revolutionary changes in the American social environment, a complete cultural and workplace change. I think it's silly, stupid, and dishonest to speak of drugs being the problem or to focus on curing addiction or to speak of people as morally weak. \n\nCountless Americans work literally back breaking jobs, try pushing even something as simple as a dust mop for hours at a time to see what I mean, and are in constant physical pain. Try asking someone who pushes a dust mop if they physically exercise on their time off and they might say why would they do that when they are literally forced into exercise at their job to point of getting muscle or other injuries which never get time to heal because you have to be at the job again the next day. \n\nAnd you can tell a lot about a person's life by their choice or choices of drugs: Alcohol, opiates to dull actual pain, amphetamines to speed up thought and body so maybe you can just think your way out of things or move ahead of things more rapidly, psychedelics so maybe you can just \"break on through to the other side\" in the immortal words of the Doors, marijuana because you just plain want to move at a more relaxed and joyful pace in an environment which permits no such thing.\n\nNo, I don't look down on drug addicts, the world we live in is a heartbreaker, it takes superhuman effort to change things for the better, and if drugs make us feel super so be it.",

        "The dropping of drugs, first heroine, then cooked cocaine ( called 'crack' ) was a series of \"setups\" to destroy a community. With the support of the United States citizens looked on, cheered, and supported the most draconian laws to punish and destroy Black and brown communities. I'd argue till today, there's a two tier system of sympathy or understanding  because as always, \"we\" never have an issue with anything, until it affects white people.\n\nMore importantly, the United States has participated in the drug trade has destabilized nations in Central and South America.  When you dig a graves for others, ya gotta get in the hole in-order to dig it. It is called karma and this is just the beginning.",

        "I do want to push back a bit on the notion that only addicts ever face limits of health care. \n\n\u201cWe would never, ever do that to someone with diabetes or cancer or any other health condition,\u201d says Dr. Wakeman. But I've seen what can happen to diabetics or cancer patients who are considered \"non-compliant\" and it's just that same.",
        "Amazing, just amazing.\n\nAs an alcoholic now 32 years sober, I got clean and sober BY MYSELF.  With the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.  With the help of my (Catholic) Church.  With the help of my family.  On my own.  No government needed or wanted.\n\nThis notion that other people get paid to get you clean and sober????\n\nSorry, but it's not how it works.",
        "The article attempts to make both \"moral\" and \"practical\" cases for treating addicted persons using very different approaches than those contemporarily available. The \"moral\" case ironically seems to be to casting current systems, processes, methods and practitioners as uncaring and inneffective at treating the addicted - in essence, framing the existing treatment framework as immoral, judgemental and purposefully designed to fail people who are simply ill (through no fault of their own, just like diabetes and cancer patients.) The \"moral\" aspects of personal responsibility are avoided. As for the \"practical\" case, it speaks of the costs of \"lost productivity\", which assumes some level of productivity across the board prior to addiction which may not necessarily have existed. It also speaks to other measureable costs without regard to the costs of the article's featured treatment options. (Having a \"support team\" of professionals available for periods of years is unlikely to yield any \"practical\" savings over  current systems and methods. Ditto for \"making treatment drugs much cheaper or free.\") The article stands the concept of \"morality\" on its head and fails to make the case for \"practicality\" - both in terms of overall cost and organizational reality - substituting smoke and mirrors rationalization for real practical analysis. If I were a thoughtful policy maker, I would be unpersuaded by this article.",
        "The Merritt Peralta Institute is a for-profit addiction treatment program in the East Bay.  If they could increase their success rates past abysmal, they'd do it.  The profits to be made for higher success rates would be insane.  \n\nKaiser is a non-profit.  They would love to lower their addiction related costs and effectively treat patients.  \n\nThe challenge is always that alcoholics and addicts choose to get clean and sober.  But frequently they choose to go back to drinking and using.  Cancer patients don't choose to get more cancer.  If they avoid treatment for a minute, they don't go back to square one.   All bets are off when the alcoholic or addict chooses to pick up again.",
        "Honestly doctors have failed us in more than this problem. Few have skills at treating problems. They\u2019re all about testing and prescriptions. \nThey don\u2019t understand basic body needs. They push idiot plans like no carbs and instead offer antidepressants. They have lost the ability to heal! \nYou have 15 minutes to try to explain what\u2019s happening in your body. Your PCP may pick up on one word or two as he is entering info in his laptop. Head he even made eye contact? \nAnd yet we as a society think these automatons are going to help in our time of need? \nThe system need rehaul from the medical schools on down. They need to study our needs not just our diseases. \nWe\u2019re in an awful situation for our neediest, poor, impoverished, elderly and those suffering both mental and physical pain that doesn\u2019t show up on texts.",
        "The further normalization of addiction and access to addictive substances through incarceration, decriminalization, public normalization campaigns, and access to treatment is perhaps the evilest thing we can do to our own people imaginable.  \n\nSubstitute cancer for drugs.  If we cancer causing agents gave people who used 10-20% of them cancer, were highly addictive (cigarettes, vaping, and quite possibly pot), and we simply decided that the right action was to take all barriers to use down, allow dealers/commercial people to make money off of it,  and to normalize their use in laws, movies, , schools, etc with the view that treating cancer was the better approach, what kind of result would we have?",
        "Two obvious thoughts: (1) The easiest way to cure addiction is not to get addicted in the first place. Since opioid addiction is so hard to treat, with multiple costly relapses the rule even in the rare instances they eventually work, then why isn\u2019t prevention more emphasized? Or do libs just find it too painful to acknowledge that Nancy Reagan was right to \u201cJust say no.\u201d (2) Singapore and, ironically, China do not have an overdose death problem. It is not a coincidence that Singapore executed 19 drug dealers last year, and had only 15 overdose deaths. China also executes drug dealers and imprisons users. Draconian punishments work. And save lives.",
        "In the effort to shift the stigma around addiction, language matters.  We speak of a cancer patient as someone who \"has cancer,\"  not someone who \"is cancerous\" or \"is a cancer.\"  Similarly, we should refer to a person suffering from a substance abuse disorder not as an \"addict,\" but as someone who \"has addiction.\"  A subtle shift in language would help drive home the point that addiction is a disease, not an identity.",
        "In 2020 the City of Toronto began handing out Free Needles and provided \"Safe Injection Sites\" for Drug users, consequences are that now thier is a small but growing army of Drug Users haunting our streets. Parks,playgrounds, school yards are littered with used needles.  2023 the City decided to hand out free Meth Pipes now those same streets are littered with used Meth Pipes . Everyone in  Toronto's the Downtown core is Afraid of being assulted, Raped  beaten, menaced, robbed . Seniors only venture out in Groups as it is too dangerous to go shopping alone.   When citizens advise local politicians & the City's massive Bureaucracy  about these new urban realities all they get back is \"Radio Silence\"   The safety of the common people matter not a wit to our Rulers.",
        "The stigma is rough. I quit drinking a year ago but I'm hesitant to say the a-word in public. I will say though, if you're thinking about getting sober, honesty with your healthcare provider is a good step. My primary care doc got me on meds that helped moderate the drinking for a while and made getting off booze entirely a lot more tolerable. Sucks because we're used to lying to doctors about how much we drink, but I took the approach that they've seen it all and are too busy to judge. Worked for me.",
        "I've posted about this before but my father died from a fentanyl overdose in October after 20 years of addiction. He had access to resources, caring family, and had been sent to rehab twice by his brother. The life still faded from his eyes on the streets of LA months ago.\n\nLegalizing these drugs is a cruel exercise in emotional and physical torture and is a fool's errand. This has already spectacularly failed in Portland. \n\nThe only solution is to lock up our southern border with all our might. The flow of brutal drugs into the country is at best, an embarrassment, and at worst, an ignored war against our citizens. \n\nMy father made his choices and abandoned my family for his addiction. Cancer is a disease, heart failure is a  disease - addiction involves real choices. You want them to stop making the choice? Make it unavailable. \n\nPlease stopping putting drugs in front of people and begging them not to take it. It's idiocy.",
        "There is no magic pill to cure one of cancer, it takes hard work and commitment to painful treatment. The same is true for addiction.

        "My only sibling, who was 10 years older than me, was a drug addict. He received treatment multiple times that he attended willingly, well, mostly to appease our parents who paid for his treatment.\nHis illness was not something that was seen as being shameful in our family. Don't get me wrong, I am, and will always be, angry at how his addiction dominated my family. My childhood home was always under the shadow of whatever drama manifested from his addiction.\nAfter many, many expensive treatments he finally stayed clean for more than a couple of weeks after leaving a program. This lasted for just over 10 years. During that time he bought a co-op, joined a gym and, by all appearances, was \"cured\".  Then he slipped and after many more years of addiction and money he finally overdosed and suffered permanent brain damage. He spent the remaining years of his life in a series of horrible institutions until his death at just over 60 years old.\nHe had support at home and money was there for treatment.\nHis addiction wasn't the product of a doctor prescribing an addictive drug that eventually led to his death; This was his own choice, maybe it was a manifestation of mental illness? I don't know but I don't feel sorry for him and I can't believe his situation was isolated.\nMaybe some of the people in this story weren't given the same opportunities as my brother and are victims of \"The Stystem\", but I can't believe that my brother was the only one who was given an honest \"chance\".",
        "How do we cure the Sackler's addiction to money?",
        "When it comes to medical intervention to addictions, which is largely physical, the medical industry and doctors suddenly shut up and go quiet. Instead of the usual suggestion of using the medication against alcohol abuse and heroine/opioid abuse, they go silent. They leave treatment up to the patient, who sits around in a circle confessing their addiction \u201csins\u201d to others in the group meeting in the basement of a church or a community center, hoping blindly that this patient will heal themselves by listening to their own confessions to find root cause, which is emotional, and not chemical and scientific. The whole industry of AA is a shame, ginned up by a religious person with no medical intervention to date. To think addiction specialists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and doctors trained in this won\u2019t speak out about it is absurd. Insurance won\u2019t cover it as a physical addiction.\n\nThey thus make it hard to use clearly known medicines that work. The silence is unethical and reflects what appears to be tacit support of the alcohol industry, making it seem like a \u201cdependency\u201d without physical \u201chooks.\u201d In short, their silence is unethical.",
        "It is easier to become an addict than kick it however people still start using things that they know better than to use so how much sympathy can one have for this type of self destructive behaviour???",
        "The federal government USED to take steps to keep drug shipments from crossing the border with Mexico.\n     The obvious question arises: did someone in the U.S. gov't take money for allowing the drug \"mules\" to flood the border?\n     That decision has added billions to the drug kingpins' pockets.",
        "Going to keep this article because there is much disagreement in Canada about how to treat addiction.\n\n\"This caught my eye:\n\nCongress passed the Ryan White Care Act, a bipartisan bill that committed billions of dollars to treating and supporting people who tested positive for the virus.\"\n\nAt Bill Clinton's inauguration gala Michael Jackson sang the song \"Gone Too Soon\" in dedication to Ryan, who Michael said was a hemophiliac and contracted SIDS at age 11, dying at 18.   Prior to singing he appealed to President Clinton to do something about the awful disease that killed his friend.  I know many people who know nothing about Michael's background and the abuse he suffered as a child, think he's a monster.  I'm not trying to change anyone's view.  But he also helped a lot of people.  And he was a drug addict, at the end even addicted to an anaesthetic I've only ever seen used in the ICU.",
        "We need to adopt harm reduction as the primary goal.  Harm reduction for addiction; harm reduction for car accidents; harm reduction for just about everything that plagues us, because that's the only way we'll conquer these Godzillas.\n\nHeck, there is still no cure for death, but don't let that stop you from going to a doctor when you're sick. It's really quite amazing what doctors and modern medicine can cure.\n\nHarm reduction is the only way. Safe needle sites will help a lot too!!",

        "The ad campaign in the 1980\u2019s of \u201cJust Say No!\u201d was mocked and derided to be a simpleton solution to a complex and important problem to address in regards to addiction.  But the truth is that it was correct.  \n\nIf you have a child have the very frank conversations on the horrors of addiction and show them the misery it results in.  My grandpa got arrested for public intoxication and my dad took me to jail with him to bail grandpa out. He said, You need to see how addiction causes this misery. You need to see a jail up close, hear it, smell it. It was scary and embarrassing.  But it worked.",
        "There is a lot of verbiage in this article. It avoids the sad fact that there is no real cure for addiction. Once in the trap, there is no way out except to hit bottom and survive in a state so afraid that you will die that you stay away from drugs. Until there is a real medication to cut the dependency, the afflicted are doomed. Throwing money into treatment is usually wishful thinking.  My dead nephew is proof of this.",
        "I was a tobacco addict from age 19, my first cigarette, until 23, smoking and until 29, chewing.  I stopped smoking (1976) after having a combination of the flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia.  Took up chewing (snuff) working in the woods to stay wide awake and stay alive.  Eventually quit that as well.  My choice.  So like many of the respondents here, I cannot understand addiction beyond one's choice, and the will to quit something unhealthy.  We aren't mean, we don't understand how one could allow their addiction to take over their life.\n  I read this article and think of the Sackler Family making billions of $ off marketing lies to doctors and killing 100K people a year.  The Sacklers are the greatest argument for reinstatement of the death penalty, every one of them.\n  The Sackler should be held responsible for every one of these opioid addicts, every one. They should be made to pay and pay and pay, until they are stripped of their ill gotten wealth.",

Whatever the government is doing isn't helping.  The American public really doesn't care about the Democrats claiming they are superior at addressing problems, compared to the Republicans, when they are getting worse.\n\nFigure it out on the local level, patent it, and take it global.

        "A close loved one with alcoholism checked themselves into an inpatient facility that came highly recommended by a premier hospital here.

        "Addiction is an illness. It\u2019s often fatal. \nMost Americans look at it as a weakness, a flaw in character. \nMy dear brother died at 36 from a heart attack after free basing cocaine for years. \nPrison, personal hardship, extreme poverty, wasted relationships\u2026nothing else mattered but getting high. \nHowever, I knew why he kept doing it. \nHe couldn\u2019t process how our dad had tried everything short of murder to get him out of our family. And he intimidated our mother in much the same way. \nMy dad, a narcissist with a violent streak, threatened our lives as children saying he could take us out anytime he wanted to. He especially resented my brother who was the only other male in our family of six. \nMy dad erased my brother. \nBut he didn\u2019t erase me and I stood my ground and have been in recovery for 36 years. A sister has been sober 23 years and another sister is nearly wet brained from drinking and pills. \nUntil family abuse and dysfunction is recognized as the matchstick that lights up addiction, nothing will change. \nPeople must escape the terrible pain either through recovery or continued addiction. \nDon\u2019t keep family secrets.

Society likely never will be able to provide the resources to fully help all of them.\n\nThe article goes on to great length to talk about the medical nature of addiction and medical treatments, but doesn't discuss the economic side, which some of the grieving parents commenting here mention.  From the Sacklers to the MD who prescribed Oxy like candy, to the Jalisco Cartel and China shipping the raw materials, it's so economically profitable that is an addiction in it's own right. \n\nFentanyl and P2P meth are so addictive, it's very hard to wean people off them.  It's not just a moral issue, but a chemical, economic and healthcare one as well.\n\nOne thing is for sure, our present myriad of Fed, State and City  programs don't work.

If you compare drug addiction to smoking or overeating and say that addiction is only hurting oneself, this article is stating otherwise... that addiction harms families, communities etc.\nSo, in the same vain, should we also be sympathetic towards pedophiles? I'm sure their brain scans would show areas of \"abnormalities\". If pedophilia were listed as a disease, how would most rational people respond?\n(This is meant to be a thought provoking question and I am in NO WAY EVER advocating for abuse of children.

But it can\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t. We would be better off diverting the non-violent with addiction out of the criminal justice system and into the public health system, full stop. \n\nFurther, we need to stop acting like addiction springs full blown out of the head of Zeus. There are biological and behavioral contributions that place some folks at greater risk of addiction than others. We need to recognize that, stop blaming people, and provide medical treatment \u2014 just as we do to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics regardless of disease causation. \n\nFinally, research shows that it can take, on average, three trips through treatment programs before addiction\u2019s hold can be loosened.

        "We need more research on why so many people are becoming addicted. What drives them to use various substances to subdue their pain? As a society we focus too much on the symptoms rather than the root cause of why something happens. Something is wrong with our society when so many people in one of the richest countries in the world cannot cope with life and need to turn to various addictive substances. I'd like to see the addiction rates across the world and compare that to various other data points. Is it the way we have set up society - winner takes all -that drives people to harm themselves? Is it the cultural acceptance of alcohol and it being cool to be high? Is it the lack of good medical care and very little attention paid to prevention because we have a model that thrives when you're sick rather than when you're healthy? Is it because to make ends meet parents have so little time to be with their children? Is it because we have a terrible food system with no nutrition? Is it the loss of community? Is it because all of these combined make it very hard to thrive and for some make it harder just to survive?",

Unfortunately, it is substantially wrong in many ways.\nI have unique experience + expertise in these matters, different and perhaps superior to most other people. \nDuring the late 1970s, the National Institute on Drug Abuse supported a data system named CODAP. I was in charge. I had written authorization from the people in charge of drug abuse to have the supreme authority to manage CODAP. It was done because otherwise the system was not manageable.\n\n We collected data from about 100K people in treatment in over 1,000 federally funded clinics (practically most clinics in the US). We had data on most people treated for drug abuse in the US. I designed, implemented, supervised the system.\n\nI prepared responses to members of Congress, The White House, news media, government agencies. We trained the states on the system. I communicated with the heads of state government agencies. I wrote reports. I visited many clinics, spoke to managers, psychiatrists, counselor across the US. Any data analysis required my review and approval. I had unique access about the effectiveness of treatment.\n\nBefore I took over, it took years to get a table of data.

        "The hardest addictions to overcome are not the ones with the worst symptoms from not taking them. Those usually offer the greater pleasurable feelings from their use. The hardest addictions to overcome are ones than offer mild pleasures with mild only mild withdrawal effects but persistent cravings. The tougher withdrawal symptoms are disincentives to resume taking the substances. This should provide some insight into why people become addicted, it's not the chemical affects but the way the individual decides to re-experience the affects or not to that results in addictions. The conditioning that sets the habitual reactions can require many repetitions or just one experience. \n\nIt took me a couple of years to quit smoking but I lost the cravings after a year of not smoking. Others have related that they continue to feel the desire to smoke long after quitting. It took a couple of years for me to lose the nausea reaction to a flavor I first tasted when a wave of nausea occurred during stomach flu.

        "After 13 years of addiction, my son recently passed away. He went to rehabs and detox places numerous times, and was sometimes kicked out for a single relapse. These places should always offer second chances. He was also on and off buprenorphine for years. The treatments and the \u201caddiction specialists\u201d were overwhelmingly ineffective and indifferent. Some places tolerated violence and drug-dealing. Precious few treated him humanely. After his final OD, after he was found  in a housing project stairwell with drug paraphernalia next to him, the hospital said they found no drugs in his system. The reason, I found out, was because it, like many hospitals in NYC, don't test for fentanyl. OD deaths are under-counted in New York. Contrary to current wisdom, there\u2019s no magic bullet, including buprenorphine. After many years of living with and losing a person I dearly loved, I think I\u2019m qualified to give some suggestions: Methadone clinics should be open seven days per week. Currently, in NYC, they\u2019re open only six days. All addiction-licensed doctors should be required to accept Medicaid in order to prescribe buprenorphine and similar meds. Likewise, addiction clinics such as the good one at Bellevue should be open all the time. Bellevue\u2019s clinic is open only two mornings per week. \nGood heroin should be available to licensed addicts so that they don\u2019t die from the poison that killed my son. \nFinally, more border control. 95% of all fentanyl comes from Mexico.",

Because of work requirements and the cost of living, neither parent, if they are still together, have time or energy to raise a child properly.  Some parents are even blaming their own children for being born.\n\n--All of our institutions have failed.  Churches are built on a lie and are repelling anyone but reich-wingers from joining.  Colleges are absurdly expensive and increasingly irrelevant.  A large percentage of Americans despise their government, even though it is the most reliable, honest and supportive institution in their lives.

It works exactly like any habit people develop, and habits are very strong behaviors. Habits do not seem powerful until one resists them. Then one becomes familiar with how hard it is to change or eliminate them. The description of addiction as a disease is a poor analogy. Diseases are external agents affecting an organism which seeks to fight them off. Addictions originate in the normal behavior of humans' reliance upon habitual behaviors to regulate themselves. and that is where it must be treated. There are powerful cravings that must be addressed to overcome and to revise the habitual behaviors, but they are conditioned reactions associated with some unfulfilled needs that are unsatisfied.",
        "I struggle between feeling deep sympathy towards individuals afflicted with addictions and having to survive on the street and feeling fear and annoyance when their messy lives spill into ours.  3 years ago, an elderly neighbor in his 80s died after an addicted homeless man took a swipe at his dog and caused my neighbor to fall and hit his head.  My neighbor survived WWII and was a refugee after the war but his life ended this way.   The homeless addict was released after being in jail for a year and is still using and is back on his usual street corner.  Two years ago, my dog ate trash left in front of my house by a homeless drug user and was hospitalized for 2 days for meth ingestion.  Last year my young daughter walked out of our house to find a man shaving using our car side mirror and wearing only underwear.  He made lewd comments to her and refused to move then proceeded to inject drugs between his toes before the police came.  \n\nWe live here too and many of us in San Francisco have compassion fatigue.  Given the always limited resources, I feel like putting effort into children now, the next generation, to prevent them becoming addicted adults is a better choice and will help more people overall than the tremendous resources needed to get adults often addicted and homeless for years, maybe in the grips of mental illness as well, off the street.  \n\nI am not sure if everyone wants to or can be helped.

        "Better treatment is needed but what it seems like everyone is failing to miss is the root issue of why so many of our friends and neighbors ended up here in the first place.

If we also made a real effort as a country to improve the education system, to focus on opportunities for meaningful work and living wages with a path to success (owning a home, buying a car) and respect for all types of work, then perhaps people would want to be a part of society, rather than wanting to escape it. Our education system is failing, job opportunities are outsourced and small town life is dying and replaced by big box stores. It's no wonder people feel hopeless and want an escape. I commend these efforts and agree the stigma and treatment around substance abuse disorder needs to change to help encourage people to get the treatment they need, but as a country we need to ensure we are providing viable pathways and opportunities that are more compelling options than drug use.",
        "Let's face it, as much as a substance abuser might want to get clean - they like getting high - it makes them feel good even though it is having negative effects on their health and their lives. I speak from experience - my own and that of family and friends. This, in addition to the physical side effects of getting clean, makes it incredibly difficult to get and stay clean.  Good treatment programs are so very very important - AND the person has to be ready to face life without the drug or drugs they have become dependent on.  \n\nThat being said, I would love to see more resources put toward prevention.  I don't have the answer, but am asking the question - primarily of the people who have had to deal with substance abuse disorders, before you got started, or early on in your experimentation, what - if anything - could have gotten you on a better path?  addressing this question and targeting at risk youth and young adults with prevention strategies will diminish the need for rehabs and improve our society.",

But addiction is tied up with crime and homelessness making it hard for the public to sympathize with addicts.  Here the overwhelming public sympathy for getting addicts into treatment led the adoption of a law decriminalizing small amounts of hard drugs for personal use.  This has further degraded public life as addicts now openly buy and use hard drugs on our streets.  Combined with a shortage of treatment options, counseling, and mental health facilities the situation is a complete mess.

My mom was paying my rent at that point in my life (long story for another day\u2014I was 19), but I attribute a lot of the success I had getting clean (and to this day staying clean) to completely rejecting \"help\" from social workers or rehab. A lot of people never even knew I was on drugs.\n\nLater, in 2013, after a long strange year between graduating from college and my life turning around, I ended up homeless on the streets of Seattle.

Thanks and well done.\n\nAnyone who has struggled with addiction, been through treatment or has loved ones struggling with addiction knows that the situation is often intractable. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with 12-step programs, know that they are firmly rooted in Christian orthodoxy. For many this is great and for others it is not, especially when there is righteous groupthink and/or judgement toward an individual. Alternatively, there are atheist and agnostic 12-step meetings that are more fluid and forgiving. There are also programs based on traditional 12-step programs which have no religious affiliation and are rooted in science and medicine more than faith.\n\nThat said, oftentimes those who are best suited to help addicts are people in recovery themselves. In fact, a crucial part of 12-step programs is bringing the message of recovery to those in need. It is circular: helping others IS part of the recovery process.\n\nCoordination between addicts in recovery and medical professionals is necessary to treat addiction. Hospital ERs have social workers on-site, many of whom are in recovery themselves. More of this is coordination needed.\n\nFinally, those who profit from addiction should pay. Drug companies and alcohol producers should be held liable. Simply saying, \u201cDrink responsibly\u201d isn\u2019t enough. \n\n\u201cFewer than 1 percent of those addicted to alcohol are being treated with medication.\u201d This is a national health emergency.",

Addiction a is biopsychosocial disease meaning genetics, mental health and psychology and living situation/community all play a role in the addiction and perpetuation of addiction. There will always be that guy who hit 'rock bottom' drinking under a bridge who bounced back with 12-stpe alone. Great for him. But that guy is not everyone. In fact the evidence very plainly shows he is the EXTREME exception, not the rule. Maybe someone else's genetics are different. Or mental health is different. Or their childhood and childhood adverse experiences are different. Or the neighborhood/family/state they live in is different. Maybe it is ALL different. All people need to be able to access all of the effective treatment options. And right now it is near impossible. The system is fragmented, underfunded, and the health system as a whole undereducated on this particular topic.

People must take ownership and responsibility for their own behavior.\n\nThe Times has printed many articles on the social needs America should address, most at great expense.  These include domestic issues such as elder care, special needs children, illegal immigration for those from broken countries, those without medical insurance, unaffordable medications, the need for lifelong custodial care for severe mental illness, and many others.  There are also the wars in Ukraine and the middle east. There is much society needs to do, but only so much we can afford. The unavoidable reality is that we need to set priorities.\n\nI believe we should make appropriate, publicly funded, care available to treat addiction.  But only up to a point. Those who repeatedly relapse need to take personal responsibility; they are committing a serious crime. At some point treating addiction as a crime is appropriate.",
        "Please also focus on prevention. Most people are treating the symptoms of trauma. We don't take care of children in our society. We should be encouraging people to plan years ahead and offer every kind of support to ensure they are as prepared as possible to become parents.\nInstead some of us get up every day determined to force girls and women to endure pregnancy and delivery against their will. Everyone involved will become an addict if they survive at all.\nPlease commit the same resources to prevention. After all, it would spare millions of people and animals the neglect and abuse that are so often a part of substance addiction.",
        "48 million Americans have a substance abuse problem. Current U.S. population is approximately 332 million. So, roughly 85% of the population does NOT have a substance abuse problem. I'm sure that many of those people have struggles, problems, economic and social issues, health problems, etc. Why do 85% avoid addiction, and 15% become addicted?",
        "My best friend has been on methadone for almost ten years.When one is taking the correct dose, it is not about getting high, but about regulating brain chemicals that become almost irreparably disregulated after years of opioid abuse. . Methadone is costly for many, around 100/week on average, but that is peanuts compared to the cost of street drugs. \nThere are a lot of restrictions on prescribing, because like any drug, it has a high potential for abuse. The recovering addict must be highly motivated to stay sober, and support groups are fundamental to success. I think we need to be wary about loosening restrictions. It is mainly the secondary support, things like transportation, clinic access that would make the most difference.\nMy friend picks up a month's supply of doses, but she had to work her way up to that over a period of years. In the beginning, the recovering addict is not able to regulate their use, so they go to the clinic daily. The good thing is, you can't get kicked out for messing up, they just drop you back to daily dosing until you can prove yourself.\nYes, there is a lot of voodoo among addicts about Methadone Maintenance Therapy. This comes from folks who abuse the program. Otherwise it has been a life saver for millions.",

The war on drugs not only empowers the criminals, fills our prisons, and costs a fortune, it simply does not and has never worked. It turns people who feel they want or need to consume certain substances into criminals, forcing them to take unsafe and adulterated forms of the drugs they, as adults, have decided they need to feel right in this crazy world. Resources could then be funneled into education, research, and, in extreme cases, treatment of problem use.",

        "Too often individuals' body-mind connections are habituated and programmed directly or indirectly through aversive teachings about \"sinful\" feelings and the \"seven deadly sins.\"  Suffering is elevated too often elevated to virtue status. \nIntegrating suffering and addiction prevention into fact based, non-moralizing, biology- based education early on might lead to children developing the sort of autonomous bodily self-awareness.  Self-awareness might facilitate safer choices regarding food, beverages, sensuality, and life in general.  I also recommend Matthew Perry's memoir.  Lots of money flows into rehabs, some of which hand new residents the \"Big Book\" of AA.  For many rehabs, aftercare consists of AA and AA, while it has helped many, has no proven track record even when it comes to alcohol.  The program is based in anonymity, so, where's the data regarding failure? \n\nI do firmly believe in Step 1 of the Twelve Steps.  We admitted we were powerless over alcohol.  Alcohol and opiates are chemicals.  We are neurochemical beings trying to maintain neurochemical homeostasis.  Too many predators benefit financially from pumping up vulnerable peoples' neurochemistry.",
        "County resource courts for arrested and convicted addicts are one step toward sobriety for many people. Mental health resource courts and addiction resource courts link the criminal justice system with a challenging but supportive two or three year program that enables participants to learn a whole new way to live and get and stay sober. These really work.\n\nFamily encouragement and ongoing emotional support also make a huge difference. This doesn't mean coddling or enabling an addict. It does mean showing up at court to show a judge and prosecutor that there's a family that still cares. It does mean regular post cards and calls and visits when an addict is in jail or prison. Prayers by family and friends and whole churches praying can also make a difference, whether or not the addict has any faith left. All love matters.",
        "I am one of the 283 million people who aren't choosing to go down a path of destruction. I've had multiple surgeries due to chronic pain and was prescribed a narcotic to manage post-operatively. I chose not to take it. Why? Because I had knowledge about the addictive nature of drugs - knowledge that I learned more than 40 years ago in high school. I also used what I learned in high school and chose not to \"experiment\", even when I had many many reasons to \"escape\".\nIn my opinion, there's is a very specific moment that all addicts choose the wrong route. It's the very moment right before they decide to go out and find more drugs. That too takes a level of consciousness and will. \nI want to have compassion but I see the outcome of people's choice - the disasters in our beautiful cities that were created by individuals without a spec of compassion for the rest of us.",

        "I recovered from drug addiction after two stints in treatment centers. The damage to me was the result of a homophobic society and narcissistic dysfunctional family. I was told as someone born gay that who I was is not who I am allowed to be. This came from religious people and accepted by society as a whole. The second part was a family with a narcissistic mother who berated and hamulated me and my twin. I was abused physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually by my family. I recovered because the drug use took me to a bottom where I became willing to change. This change was joining AA and adopting a black German shepherd puppy. The date February 18th  2005. I learned from the program AA that I needed to change for others to change around me. It was apparent I was not equipped  to handle life on life's term, the 12 step program gave me the road map, but it was the unconditional love from my dog that gave me the courage to change. It was the first time in my life that I had experience  this type of love. When the dog passed in 2016 I felt true  grief for the first time as well. By this time I was a different person, life had gotten better. I remember understanding the gift the puppy had given me and decided to keep on the path to honor his memory. The point is life had set me up to fail and the drug abuse almost killed me. I am one of the lucky ones but had I experience acceptance and love at an earlier age my life would have been much different.",

Examples of addiction include not only drug abuse, but food intake, power trips, etc.  Ever watch the athlete who can't stop running.  Or the boss who gets off on dressing down individuals.  Or the person who struggles with food.  All are addictions stimulated by feedback to the brain.  \n\nI wish we would take a step back, stop moralizing everything, and think about how best to help one another.

        "I find myself astonished by an apparent lack of interest by NYT readers in this article. Nearly every issue that this very excellent piece by Ms. Interlandi discusses has affected me and my family. Both my children are heroin & meth addicts & have been for 12 years. \nThey came to these drugs for different reasons. My oldest suffers from treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Over the past 15 years, therapy & every psychotropic medication has failed to help her. It is a struggle for her EVERY DAY not to commit suicide to end her suffering. She says heroin is the only thing that has ever given her a moment of mental and emotional peace, but at great cost to her and me. She contracted a MRSA infection that permanently damaged her heart & very nearly killed her at age 32. After 6 weeks in hospital, 5 days on ventilator, months at home on IV antibiotic therapy that I administered, tied to a catheter with loss of bowel control, & months of physical therapy (mostly out-of-pocket @ $100/day) to get her to even be able to walk again, she went back to using. That is the depth of her despair. Shame & stigma are real for both addicts & families. I have such horrifying tales to tell. \nMy younger daughter is a different story with different tragic circumstances. Prison without ordered treatment, beaten by inmates & untreated concussion, using drugs in prison, released addicted. My two bright, compassionate girls, & me, reduced to nearly death. In 2023, there must be a better path.",

        "Over the last decade or so, we have seen a massive shift in how we talk about addicts and addiction in general. \n\nWe call it a disease. We don't blame the user. We have in many cases taken away the threat of jail. We give people places to use these awful drugs. \n\nWe say it isn't their fault and we criticize anyone who dares suggest enforcement of drug laws might be part of the solution.\n\nWe almost never talk about prevention. \n\nAnd despite all of these feel-god changes, and despite pouring tens of billions of dollars into this problem, the situation is worse than ever. \n\nWe need to bring personal responsibility back into this mix. Responsibility to avoid these drugs in the first place. And when addicted, responsibility to get off these drugs. \n\nAsking nicely while facilitating users habits is not solving anything.",

        "It really ought to be an embarrassment that the richest country in history is letting tens of thousands of its people die in the streets. I walked down a busy, six-lane street a few weeks ago for just a block or two and there were at least two or three men in their 20s or 30s lying unconscious on the sidewalk. One had a kind of a rag of a blanket. I don't think they were dead but make no mistake, they are dying, in our streets. \n\nAround them people went about their business in cars, on foot, on scooters. Everybody is so used to it that they just ignore it. Some only care that it's an eyesore, or perhaps a danger to them. \n\nAt the same time, a disturbing number of voters really think that we would somehow suffer if billionaires were taxed a little more. Especially the GOP. That's a red line they won't tolerate being crossed. I think a country that believes it's special and cares what the rest of the world thinks of it should really be ashamed of what we have become.",
        "When a columnist resorts to hyperbole to make their point their credibility is reduced in proportion to how far they stretch the truth.  One in 7 Americans suffer from addiction (48M out of 340M)? Perhaps if one includes alcohol, smoking and cell phone use in the penumbra of substances that are abuse, but certainly not if one is referring to narcotics.  As many Americans died from drug overdoses in the last 24 years as have died in all our wars?  1.3 million Americans have died in all our wars while opioid deaths totaled about 700 thousand since 1999, only one half of what Janeen alleges.  And if she believes treatment should be voluntary and not coercive, then there is no chance we could help a significant number of addicts.  If they were willing to choose treatment, they would choose not to use their drugs. It is impossible to cure illnesses which people willingly bring on themselves.",
        "I've never been addicted to anything, at least not drugs or alcohol. Still, my father and his mother, and then her mother, both struggled with various addictions. So I've always acted as if I had the capacity for addiction, and I believe it was the right thing to do. If my initial cravings for, by way of example, a pain killer prescribed after surgery are a measure. I was right to do so. \n\nI have no doubt that addiction is real. That some substances change the chemistry of your body to turn something deemed necessary (like hydrocodone) or seemingly innocuous (like alcohol or, to a lesser extent, tobacco) can change the chemistry of your body or brain and make them a necessity. That's addiction, and I know from first-hand observation how difficult it is to reverse. Addicts need all the help they can get, the first of which is to head off addiction before it begins. The last is, never give up on them. Even if they remain clean and sober for even a few weeks or months at a time, the effort is worth it.",
        "These articles frequently declare that probation officers or other members of the court system don\u2019t know anything about addiction or treatment, but they never interview people in those respective fields. \n\nThe fact is that treatment is hard. It will always be easier to go get high than to get sober and nothing is going to change that.",
        "People who end up addicted after being prescribed opioids for pain management are not who I am addressing here; there are  many parents and other adults who continue to talk about how natural it is for teens to \"experiment\" with drugs and alcohol, who talk to their teens about their own (the parents') drug use when they were younger as a way of opening the channels of communication.  It's not working.  Do you really want your kids to experiment with drugs in this day and age? Why do we assume this is a \"natural\" part of growing up, somehow an inevitable step in gaining independence and autonomy and adulthood?",
        "Speaking as a person recovered from alcohol use disorder, with 23 years of continuous sobriety, another aspect to the solution would be to abandon the notion of treating drug use disorders and alcohol use disorder as the same thing.\n\nAs for the statement that 12-Step programs \"have also been known to actively discourage the use of lifesaving anti-addiction medications.\" The Tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous is to \"have no opinion on outside issues.\" Should medical science come up with a cure for alcoholism, \"our hats are off to you.\"",

There will be no economic incentive to push drugs (say I saw cocaine being used in way too many modern movies to consider it to be uncorrelated events of artistic expression).\n2. It will remove financial pressure from addicts and leave them more resources to fight addiction and leave life as normal as possible.\n3. Drug usage will become uncool and boring.\n4. We had some success dealing with alcohol addictions  - it is way lesser evil.\n5. Some people will die but many more will survive.\n\nIt would never happen.",
        "Another point not addressed here is that there is nothing available for people who are elderly AND have addiction.

It's horrible. Treatment far earlier, and better systems to stop addiction before it begins are critical.",

He didn\u2019t want any help from the paramedics and an hour later I saw him stumbling around another street\u2026the sad truth is that too many addicted people do not want to be helped.",
        "Get Real!  The \"system\" is not the problem.   Given the resources that have been poured into this problem, and the variety of approaches that have been tried, it is obvious the  ONLY way the addict will change is when the addict decides to do so, and that is a function of how painful life has become.\n     The oldest, and perhaps the best recovery program--AA--has a recovery rate of about 5%--five percent make it to their fifth year of sobriety.  And very few of those who \"need\" the program even begin.\n     I've been clean & sober for 39 years ONLY because of how painful my life had become, together with the fellowship provided by AA meetings.  The \"system\" had been available for years, but I didn't look for the solution until the pain became overwhelming.\n      Bottom line: Very few will even look for a solution, and most of those (see above) will blame the continuation of THEIR problem on \"The System.\"",
        "48 Million?\n\nThat's a CRAZY number!\n\nMy mother gets methadone at a CODAC clinic, and for the most part she is able to function normally. Still I'm not okay with it. It bothers me that the system is set up to \"maintain\" users and so they remain addicted indefinitely. This to me is a cash machine and not about compassion. Compassion would be helping others become independent.\n\nThe real question is WHY are 14% of Americans using drugs in the first place? There must be something very wrong with the way we are raised and our values if so many people feel the need to use. This doesn't even include alcohol's figures! Maybe we need to re-examine our priorities in this country? Maybe our spirits are lost in a material world that we continue to push as the answer, when clearly we are in pain and looking for a way out.",
        "The basic problem is that our society doesn't care enough about the problem to fix it.  A small fix might be to have doctors stop proscribing opioids.  Not only does this give patients \na taste which can lead to additional use, but also the implication of acceptance.",

In that respect, America has been failing for the past 40 years.

        "Father of an only child who died after an overdose here. He suffered as a teen to his passing at 25. My wife and I continue to suffer today, now especially as his birthday is upon us. There are many opinions, pundits,  and countless articles about addiction, or as is termed now, substance use disorder. Let\u2019s talk about the real world. Our son did not choose addiction. He did as many of you might, experimented. The difference his brain and body craved the next high. Personal responsibility? Our son worked to stop, 8 rehabs, years of counseling, medications to help stop. AA, NA? Tried and failed. When you are young the immaturity and feeling of invincibility can overwhelm reality, even when reality is killing you.\n\nThe courts tried to help. We met some incredibly compassionate judges but he kept failing after 3 months being clean. Just when we truly believed success was here we get a call from the NYPD, dead in a Brooklyn SRO, our last sight of him lying on a gurney after an autopsy we didn\u2019t want. He suffered enough. We knew the cause of death. Want to talk about rock bottom?\n\nWe walked the halls of Congress for legislative help. They listened, passed laws, did not fund the programs and declared victory to constituents. Look up CARA if you don\u2019t believe me.\n\nCannabis/drug legalization? It\u2019s all about profit. Those like my son are just the cost of doing business. Ask the Attorneys General who settle rather than prosecute. Am I bitter? No, my eyes are wide open.",
        "Two things can be true at once. Yes, addiction treatment in our country is wildly inadequate AND time spent in rehab is never wasted. Relapse is part of recovery. \n\nAfter brutal years of walking my son down the recovery road, I can testify that we are not losing the worst of us to drugs, we are losing the best of us--the creative, the intelligent, the ones exquisitely sensitive to the pain in this world. In their thwarted attempts to escape the beast, they drive themselves deeper into its belly. Still, my son, on the worst day of his addiction, was a better human than most humans I have known.  \n\nAn opioid prescription after a car wreck cast my teenage son down the dark rabbit hole. It took him several tries on the rehab merry-go-round before he discovered he can't touch the stove anywhere. It's hot all over. He is thriving now and committed to living \"happy, joyous, and free.\" \n\nMy son has the heart of a lion and one stubborn mom, and that's why he is still alive. Once I abandoned the deadly myth of \"tough love\" and walked toward the monster with him, instead practicing \"unyielding love\" and setting healthy boundaries, he grew stronger. When we get better, they get better. Long-term treatment, MAT, care, and support are key to overcoming an opioid use disorder. \n\nIf your loved one does finally break the chains of chemical slavery, please know you love and support someone who is remarkably courageous.

        "Our citizens have forgotten about personal responsibility. Addiction is a horrible, horrible thing. But outside of where drugs are prescribed by a physician, there was a conscious choice to take them. From the time I was a child I was educated on the perils of drugs. My family and I have all been prescribed opioids for pain in the past. We took them very sparingly, if at all. There are many awful stories where people are sadly under-educated about the dangers of these drugs and become addicted via prescribed medications. But there are many more where taking the drugs after procuring them illegally, is a CHOICE. It is time people in this country take responsibility for their lives. And if they don't, they need to stop assuming everyone else will.",

I can understand how a person can become addicted to opioids because doctors prescribe them, and who doesn't really trust a doctor?\n\nPain is debilitating and people will do anything to get out of pain and no one can experience other person's pain and don't understand.\n\nThe makers of Oxycontin have been sued and I think the case is in the SCOTUS.  We can't stop people from taking harmful drugs any more than we can stop people from buying alcohol or breathing.\n\nNo one really knows how to solve this problem and blaming China or the American border is not the whole answer since drugs can be made stateside.\n\nNancy Reagan had a silly and ridiculous quote \"Just Say No\" but that was too simple.  I can't believe that people want to live in this altered state and lose their ability to enjoy life.\n\nThese drug users do need help but one size does not fit all, and some people don't want to stop.\n\nIt is a sad commentary on America and other parts of the world.  Perhaps there is no real solution on how to help.",

PCPs are overburdened with way too much paperwork and menial tasks that take away from actual patient care. Much of that comes from the insurance industry denying care and denying payments.

        "As the article clearly explains, it is both the cost-effective, and the moral thing do to make treatment more accessible.  We need to put aside our feelings that those who suffer addiction may have brought it upon themselves and are blameworthy.  Maybe so, maybe not.  But if we can help them recover, we should. And helping them may go a long way to addressing homelessness as drug addiction can be a precursor to homelessness and an impediment for those presently homeless getting out of that situation.",
        "Would be interested to see the source data claiming that medical treatment and counselling has the same success rate as statins.  I've heard that the opioid blockers or substitutes are having enormous success but are technically opioids themselves and are heavily regulated in some states. My own experience in treatment, with individuals willing and very much wanting to quit in a residential setting with good standards of care, still had a 90% relapse rate within 12 months of finishing the program. I was in a transition house for 10 months... it was a magnificent place, a mansion donated to the city for housing recovering alcoholics by a wealthy benefactor with 12 rooms, big stone fireplace (was an old hunting lodge). 3 meals a day and onsite counselling daily, individual counselling, medication distribution.  Of the 80 people that rotated through during my time there, me and one other person were the only ones not to relapse.  Of the people who relapsed, a large number did so temporarily but got back on track... an even larger number went back to using fulltime again. This did build a system of sorts that expected failure, counsellors who constantly suspected clients were using and a wall of sorts between staff and patients by staff who were constantly disappointed and bitter. Rules were set up organically to separate those likely to relapse, curfews and other responsibilities that would push out those likely to relapse and leave only the very determined.",

        "An area that needs further exploration is preventing people from getting addicted in the first place.\n\nMany health care professionals and families of addicts say that addiction starts as recreational use, that friends and family offer the drugs.  They say that blaming legitimate prescription drugs is often just an excuse to pass the buck from irresponsible behavior.\n\nWe have to ask hard and honest questions about how people get addicted in the first place and what can be done to prevent it.  Another hard question we must ask is if some addicts actually don't want to get clean.\n\nHow many drug addicts began using to self-medicate untreated mental illness?  Years ago the state mental hospitals were closed.  We need much better mental health care, and maybe that might reduce drug use.\n\nSome school districts use dogs to search students for narcotics.  Teachers in affluent districts say drug use is rampant, even in middle school.  If that is true, we have to ask ourselves why that is.  Are kids so stressed out that turn to drugs?  Are kids so bored they turned to drugs for recreation or to be cool?\n\nI doubt anyone who starts taking drugs expects to turn out as an addict living in misery on the streets.  I suspect they assume they'll be able to handle it.\n\nSadly, our society had justified drug abuse.  Our TV and film jokes about it, or minimizes the consequences. \n\nLong ago Nancy Reagan suggested the \"Just Say No\" campaign.  This was widely mocked.  But was the idea really bad?",
        "An object of addiction can be almost anything - drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping. . . we engage in activities to feel good or to feel better. The substance or behavior - the object of addiction isn't what is important. Addiction is functional. - it serves while it destroys. The activity or the object becomes more important, desired, and craved.  previously important activities become less so in the complex struggle acting on the impulse, and resisting that impulse when this causes suffering to health, family, work, every day life it's addiction. \n\nPeople live with addiction, we engage in addictive behaviors to escape pain, discomfort, suffering  - both physical and emotional.",

        "An excellent piece, and should be required reading among health-care professionals. As a psychologist specializing in addictive disorders, I realize that one of the biggest obstacles, and one hardest to overcome, is generalized stigma among both the lay population and within the helping professions. This stigma is exacerbated by a striking lack of training for health-care professionals, which can be rectified more readily than the stigma of addiction as a personality disorder or a moral failure. \n\nTwo nits to pick: \nThe focus of this piece is understandably on opiates. Often ignored is the far larger number of people who are affected by alcohol. Death rates from alcohol exceed opiate deaths by a significant margin.\n \nThe second nit is the subtle disparagement of 12-Step programs, which can be quite effective (a recent Cochrane report solidly demonstrates this). While there is some truth that some AA/NA groups discourage the use of buprenorphine and methadone, this is slowly changing, and should be encouraged everywhere. And data showing the effectiveness of AA, and addiction treatment in general, should be promulgated among the helping professionals, and in society in general.",

        "Fascinating read on many levels. I have a thought I'd like to share, albeit a single data point, an unusual one, since no street drugs (i.e. uncertainty) were ever involved. \n\n\"Trading one addiction for another is what they call it,\" quoting Mr. Davis. \n\nI have to agree. In 2010 I sustained a three column burst fracture in the T-12 vertebrae. I was immediately placed on IV fentanyl in the hospital, then graduated to a patch after leaving orthopedic rehab in a full-horse (clamshell) brace. Unfortunately my bones didn't heal, and I was put on a study drug, which forced healing over a two year period. Once healing was complete, the pain was from a \"non-union,\" easily corrected by injecting bone cement. Just like that, my physical pain was over, now came the arduous task of getting off fentanyl. \n\n My insurance would cover just one week in drug rehab, and was immediately put on buprenorphine. Right away I was extremely euphoric, something I'd never experienced with fentanyl. Without a clone who didn't get buprenorphine, I can't know how things would have gone without, but after leaving a week later,  I was in agony with severe withdrawal symptoms. I didn't pursue additional suboxone treatment, since the reason I wanted off fentanyl is that my pain was cured with surgery and I didn't like who I was on it. More suboxone would be, as Mr. Davis said, training one addiction for another. I got though it, but would have rather used other medicines to combat side effects. Best to all.",
        "So many words in this addiction article and yet the alcohol recovery program proven to work the best, 12 step recovery, is described as prescriptive, formulaic, etc\u2026.    Check the Stanford research et. Al. That shows (without bias), 12 step recovery is the solution for alcohol use disorder.  (5 years sober in January)",
        "There just isn\u2019t any simple solution.  12 step programs do work, as evidenced by the estimates of over 2 million people in about 180 countries who have been able to find recovery.  BUT that is by far not the only solution.  I have been sober 33 years, and have watched numerous people die who weren\u2019t able to stay clean, for a variety of reasons.  It is heart breaking.  I love the fact that this article includes so many approaches.\n\nOne of the reasons any program of recovery works is that it is based on connecting with others.  The simple fact of neurology is that brains heal brains.   Connection with others is key.  Whatever people can find is good.   AA was started by a bunch of men in the 1930\u2019s.  We need different, more open ways of creating this connection.  I am also a therapist and have been working in the field for over 29 years.  There is a rather simple concept that treatment often misses.  Addiction memories are stored as positive.  As such, the usual ways of processing negative memories don\u2019t work.  You treat the addiction memory as a positive and then you are able to unlink the association between the drug and the positive memory. \n\nFinally, treatment centers have not been working.  A recent lawsuit against a drug company resulted in a billion dollar settlement, and much of that was funneled into existing treatment programs.  These programs exist to make a profit.  This may sound cynical, but if people get clean and stay clean then the profits dry up.",

These programs discharge participants to the streets with no further options for housing, transportation, or continued care. All of which are daunting to face while still struggling to control a substance use disorder. \n\nPeople who suffer with substance use disorder are people, our friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors.

        "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to wait for new drugs or treatments to do the same for addiction.

        "The article is an important reminder that we\u2019re dealing with people whose lives are a mess and need help.  No one who is addicted wants to be there.  Comments like \u2018most don\u2019t seek help\u2019 or \u2018the addict must want to succeed\u2019 are neither accurate nor helpful.  Imagine a teen who was raised with the moral foundation we want everyone to have, who goes to a party and tries something new along with a bunch of their friends.  Some of them are barely affected, some have a bad reaction, but one feels as if they were hugged by God.  That one teen will want the feeling again and even if they know it\u2019s wrong, their brain is saying that was too good to pass up.  The inevitable consequences don\u2019t dampen the craving.  Ignoring biology allows us to pretend their addiction is their fault, that their moral failings are the reason they and their families are in disarray and suffering.  Punishing people for bad decisions that lead to addiction and further degrade their lives, and those of the people around them, is not what a caring society should condone.  The science is there to improve their lives and arguments about the cost to help usually ignore the costs of not helping.  People who are addicted need our help \u2013 we are not meant to be alone when we are struggling so hard and any approach that isolates the most needy among us will fail, as we\u2019ve seen.  We all need connection to others and kindness is never wasted.",
        "A comprehensive overview.  There are several factors overlooked in the failure to treat addictions that are worth noting.  First, there are a plethora of opinions and competing schools of thought about \u201cthe best way\u201d to treat these disorders. Second, the author might mention that it is not simply \u201claw enforcement vs medical\u201d that are at odds here.  Many want to address social factors and \u201croot causes,\u201d rather than focus on the patient themselves.  Third, as a society, we have conflicting policies - injection sites, alcohol, gambling, mushrooms, cannabinoids and tobacco?  Check.  Everything else, not so much.  Finally, mandatory treatment is still frowned upon.  Given all of these issues, even if we found a \u201ccure\u201d for whatever, our fractured views of addiction would prevent its deployment.",
        "This excellent  article does state that we need to regulate addiction providers, but I would like to underscore that need.

But everyone knows it is rare, probably never happened, that a person is suddenly cured after 28 days.   Because money for rehabs opened up after Obama care, charlatans flocked to the field. Yes, on paper many offer follow up. In reality, most don\u2019t. Also the follow up is not covered by insurance.  We need better follow up care than telling people to go to AA. \n\nIt may be that an older person who lived a largely functional life and got addicted through prescriptions can come out the other side with 28 days plus AA or Smart Recovery, but not those who started young. \n\nThe other fact I would like to point out is that EVERY GIRL in my daughter\u2019 s  rehabs had been raped.

        "Special thanks to the New York Times for their continual work to unravel the problems of addiction.  \n\nThe big point, that addiction should be treated as a medical issue, not a crime, is correct.  There was no mention of Portugal, which has gone from leading Europe in overdose deaths, to one of the lowest in deaths.  They did it by making opiates almost legal and easy to get, but require counseling to get and can't be consumed in public.  By controlling what they get, unknown stronger doses that kill people are eliminated.  Pretty simple.\n\nThe elephant in the addiction room, of course, is alcohol.  Not much mention of it, either.  The collateral damage and death numbers of alcohol far surpass opiates, but alcohol is our national drug.  One of the big mysteries of the universe is how alcohol has escaped the \"drug\" label it most certainly owns.  As the most \n\"dis-inhibiting drug\", it turns some users into out of control maniacs.  we've all seen it many times.  However, Jesus turned water into wine as his first miracle, and said there is wine in heaven, etc. etc.  Do you think most priests and judges enjoy a glass of good wine after a hard day's work?\n\nAlcohol is promoted as the a key to the good life.

The majority of drug addicts have made an unsound choice, now it appears that many want to find a way out, still, their choices have wasted valuable resources and hindered those with actual pain from getting the medication they need. And finally, every doctor knows about addiction, I'm one, I see patient prescription logs each time they come for a visit, I know when they have a problem without them opening their mouths, so we need to end drug seeking behavior, along with doctors will to feed it ... yet most of all, we need to accept that many simply wish to waste their lives.",

City and county hospitals are dumping grounds for patients that are more difficult to treat whether it be addiction or complex medical care due to disability or rare genetic disorders. These patients take time and cost a lot to care for when insurance either doesn\u2019t pay or pays very little. Where are the social workers?

(I am familiar with Joan Larson's work, but hopefully there is a vast amount of published material and training available on this topic.)  Drug abuse depletes the body of amino acids that are required for proper neurotransmitter functioning, and so the person becomes dependent on the drug to not feel terrible.  Building back up the natural stores of amino acids is the key to getting the neurotransmitters to function normally again so that the patient feels normal so that they don't need the drug anymore.  Examples of amino acids:  tryptophan or 5HTP to build back up serotonin; DPA (D-Phenylalanine) to build back up endorphins; tyrosine to build back up dopamine, and GABA to build back up GABA.  Amino acids are inexpensive and go to the root of the problem rather than masking the problem.

Lying, stealing, repeated promises to change, only to be broken.  These accompanying realities contribute to the strict, almost unbending rules are placed in treatment centers.  The shame addicts experience is as much about those behaviors as the substance abuse itself.  Addiction is more than a medical matter it's a systemic illness, social as well as spiritual however anyone would define that.  \n\n I would also encourage the Times to do a second piece on prevention of addiction.  Consider \"recreational\" drug use that supposedly does no harm to anyone, but funds the cartels and gangs that distribute.  The loneliness epidemic.  The culture of alcohol consumptions to \"take the edge off\" whatever is a stressful reality.  Not to mention, the pain management reality of our medical community, and our overall proclivity to \"take a pill\" to address an issue rather than consider behavioral change.",
        "Constantly overlook is that these scourges are a BUSINESS. There are profit makers at the root of illegal drug use and distribution, and they are making millions tearing to shreds the social fabric of our society. Like any high-profit business it is self-sustaining via the hard work of it's entrepreneurs ie dealers. The cycle is dealer to new user/customer, who transitions to perfect customer (an addict) who enriches the dealer. \n\nIt is not the addict who is the main victim of this cycle, it is the new user, who falls out of the working or scholastic life to a life that revolves around getting and using the drug. The illegal drug sales & distribution cycle needs to be broken, if new users are to be directed away from addiction. Helping addicts is a separate medical issue that should be accomplished by replacing dealers, who do not care about humanity, with professionals, who do. And addicts have to help, because they have the secret knowledge on dealers. When is the last time anyone heard of an addict turning in their dealers? This should be required.\n\nAddicts should be prescribed the illegal chemicals that they cannot live without and also put on rehab paths. When they fail their rehab path they would thus fall back on caring professionals not dealers. In exchange for that support addicts should and must turn in dealers, who should go to jail. This process replaces the inhuman dealer with the humane professional, who will not because of ethics provide drugs to new users.",
        "AA and 12-step programs have saved millions of lives including mine. I support all the suggestions and initiatives in this article but in the end, the addict must want to succeed and if they don't, no agency, funding or social worker can help them.",
        "This very long and informative article touches on everything but what the many recommended steps and programs to deal with the widespread scourge of addiction would cost.\n\nAs a psychologist I particularly appreciate the author\u2019s emphasis on expanding programs based on research and science-based evidence.\n\nHowever, scaling successful programs to the national level would require monumental sums that could only come from federal, state and local government; taxpayers want\u2014and deserve\u2014to know what these costs would be.",
        "The issue is simply many of those addicted to drugs never seek help. We visited San Francisco last year, I was shocked by what I can describe as apathy. Many homeless individuals, of which many of them were clearly suffering from severe mental illness, but no one cares for them. Many were doing drugs and using needles openly on the street and the police were just indifferent. Well meaning organisations that supply clean needles and paraphernalia to prevent harm are actually enabling drug abuse. We need drug arrests and court ordered mandatory residential center treatments followed by regular check to make sure they have not fallen back on old habits (like how criminal justice system uses probation). ABC  news reported that federal employees have been told to work from home amid the crime and drug use outside of their building in the San Francisco. Recently, Nordstrom closed its flagship SF store. \n\nWe could invest billions into treatment programs, but nothing will change if we continue with a laissez-faire approach to open drug use that many cities have adopted. This is bad for vitality and safety of cities as the case from SF shows, but also bad for people who are addicted to drugs. We are condemning them to early death and poor quality of life by not forcibly removing them from the streets and sending them to treatment centers.",
        "My daughter's fight with opioid/heroin addiction began when she was 14. It ended suddenly, in a fatal overdose five years ago, when she was 30. She lost. Fight over. Case closed. I was by her side through it all. Detox, rehab, meth clinics, jail, childbirth, repeat.  Sixteen years of torture. The indignities heaped upon her by both the medical system and the criminal justice system meant to help her -- indignities that were mostly unnecessary and avoidable -- are  so very well described in Ms. Interlandi's story.  Thank you for that.",
        "1) There are good and bad addiction treatment centers; 2) addictions don't happen by themselves, they come with co-morbidities such as Depression, Anxiety, PTSD as well as adverse childhood experiences; 3) addiction is usually a family disease in the sense that there is dysfunction in the family that enables it to happen and maintains it; 4) people who are addicted have to reinvent themselves after treatment and not return to their previous enabling peers; 5) if we know scientifically that it is a medical condition, why the judicial system seeks to punish it? 6) addiction is any compulsive behavior that provides temporary pleasure (increasing Dopamine levels) and is maintained even though it provides the person with negative consequences.",
        "I'm always amazed at these articles that talk about how much treatment costs fail to mention anything positive about Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.  These programs are free and have helped millions of people worldwide become drug free.  Also, the article claims that people who are are on replacement drug therapy are shunned in these programs.  That is not true.  AA's and NA's position on replacement drug therapy is that, if it's prescribed by a doctor, it is an outside issue.",
        "There are regulatory concerns about contingency management. Patients come to the doctor, insurance pays for the visit, the doctor's practice gives the patient money (or another good) as a reward for having no drugs show on urine drug screen. This violates anti-kickback rules. A doctor is not allowed to give you, say, $100, for picking him or her to do your Medicare reimbursed hip surgery.",
        "Buprenorphine saved my young niece's life, but only after her family abandoned her to the streets and I took her in, after she relapsed on multiple cold-turkey programs, and a short stint in jail which led to a court mandated program. But she didn't really clean up until I insisted that her mother get her into a program that administered the medication. Six years later she has a four-year-old daughter who's thriving and she has her master's degree in behavioral child psychology. She was lucky, we had the health care resources to get her treatment, and she had family that still clearly cared about her. But almost everything we did for her could be easily replicated if people understood what is happening to addicts instead of this Puritan insistence on this disease as personal failings. She showed me a film called Unwoven Pleasure which recasts addiction as a disease. I recommend it to anyone seeking to understand.",
        "Sure there is a significant percentage that can be treated; but there's also significant percentage that after years on P2P meth and tranq - there's nothing left to treat. Acknowledging that reality is important to targeting who can be really treated with any possibility of success."
